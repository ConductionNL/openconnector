/**
 * Renames the two camelCase endoflife.date schema slugs to snake_case.
 *
 * `eolProduct` and `eolCycle` were the only camelCase slugs among the 55 this
 * app declares. Every other slug is snake_case, and a register that spells two
 * of its schemas differently from the other fifty-three is a register whose
 * URLs cannot be guessed.
 *
 * WHY A ROW RENAME IS SAFE. An object is bound to its schema by NUMERIC ID, not
 * by slug: every shard table's `_schema` column holds the id, and the tables
 * themselves are named `oc_openregister_table_<registerId>_<schemaId>`. There is
 * no slug anywhere in the physical layout, so renaming one re-points nothing and
 * can strand nothing. The eight seeded `eolProduct` objects and their magic
 * table follow the rename untouched.
 *
 * WHY THIS HAS TO BE A REPAIR STEP AND NOT JUST A FRAGMENT EDIT.
 * `ImportHandler` matches an incoming schema by `$data['slug']`, never by the
 * dict key it is filed under. Change the slug in the register fragment alone and
 * the importer finds no match, CREATES a second schema, and leaves the original
 * row, its magic table and its eight objects in place forever — the import
 * unions schema ids into the register and never removes one. Renaming the row
 * first is what makes the fragment land on the schema that already exists.
 *
 * WHY THE STORED REFERENCES MOVE TOO. A synchronization addresses its target as
 * the literal string `<registerSlug>/<schemaSlug>`, so the eight seeded
 * endoflife-date synchronizations hold `integriq/eolCycle` in `target_id`. The
 * seeds are re-imported with the corrected value, but an operator's own
 * synchronization pointing at the same schema is not, and a target that resolves
 * to nothing fails at run time rather than at import. So this step rewrites the
 * stored value as well, guarded on an exact match.
 *
 * ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING. It runs BEFORE `InitializeRegister`, for the reason
 * above: after the import, the duplicate schema already exists and this step can
 * only refuse.
 *
 * NON-DESTRUCTIVE AND IDEMPOTENT. It renames only when the old slug is present
 * and the new one is not; a second run finds nothing to do and says so. It
 * refuses rather than merges when both exist, because two rows sharing a slug
 * means the lower id silently wins every lookup, and choosing between them is a
 * decision about data. It never throws: under `<install>` an escaping exception
 * aborts the install and the app never enables at all.
