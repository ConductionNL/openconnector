/**
 * Integriq Brokered Call Service.
 *
 * Isolates ALL coupling between the outbound HTTP call engine and the
 * OpenRegister credential broker (`OCA\OpenRegister\Service\Credential\
 * CredentialBrokerService`). A Source whose merged configuration carries
 * `authentication.credentialRef` is validated, resolved, and dispatched
 * IN-PROCESS through the broker's constrained proxy (owner IDOR →
 * allowedApps → provider allowRules → host-lock, secret injected
 * server-side) instead of the engine's internal Guzzle client. The broker's
 * `array{status, headers, body}` return is adapted to a PSR-7 response so
 * `CallService`'s CallLog / redaction / retention / rate-limit pipeline runs
 * unchanged. The consuming app NEVER holds the secret — with brokering it
 * never enters this process at all (REQ-SBC-004).
 *
 * Config errors (sibling embedded secrets, ambiguous names, missing
 * credentials, v1 scope violations, unavailable broker, sessionless calls
 * against a broker without acting-user support) throw
 * {@see BrokeredCallConfigurationException}; the engine maps them to
 * synthetic 409 config-error CallLogs. There is NO fallback to embedded
 * authentication under any circumstance.
