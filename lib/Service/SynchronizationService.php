	 * Parses an HTML response body into an array of records using CSS
	 * selectors (oc#107 — openalternative, don_oss_register,
	 * wikipedia_comparisons: plain web pages with no API, whose data sits in
	 * an HTML table or a repeating list of cards).
	 *
	 * `configuration.htmlSelector` (required) is a CSS selector matching the
	 * repeating record container — e.g. `table tbody tr` for an HTML table,
	 * or `.card`/`li.item` for a card/list layout. Each matched container
	 * becomes one record. `configuration.htmlFields` (a `fieldName =>
	 * selector` map) then extracts one value per field, relative to that
	 * container: `selector@attr` extracts the named attribute (e.g.
	 * `a@href`); a selector with no `@attr` extracts trimmed text content
	 * instead. An empty selector (just `@attr`) reads the attribute off the
	 * container element itself, for the common case where the container IS
	 * the link (e.g. `li.item` containing `<a href="...">Name</a>` where
	 * `htmlSelector: "li.item"` and a field selector of `@href` would need
	 * `a@href` instead — an empty selector targets the container, not the
	 * first descendant).
	 *
	 * Uses `Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler` (with `symfony/
	 * css-selector` translating the CSS selectors to XPath) — the standard,
	 * well-maintained PHP library for exactly this task, already MIT/EUPL
	 * compatible and added specifically for this change (see design.md). A
	 * missing `htmlSelector`, or a field selector that fails to match, MUST

	 * ⚠️ THE READ IS DELIBERATELY UNSCOPED, and delegating to `getRuleById()`
