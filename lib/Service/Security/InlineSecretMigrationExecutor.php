/**
 * Integriq Inline Secret Migration Executor.
 *
 * Phase C (executor half) of ocon#151 / ADR-064 §6. Where
 * {@see InlineSecretMigrationPlanner} only REPORTS what would migrate, this
 * class actually REWRITES LIVE CREDENTIALS: for every `source` object that
 * still holds an INLINE secret (`apikey`, `secret`, `password`, `jwt`) it mints
 * an OpenRegister broker credential, VERIFIES the secret round-trips, and only
 * then writes the `{credentialRef}` placeholder and nulls the inline value.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS NOW (the Phase C blocker is resolved)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Phase C originally shipped WITHOUT an executor: ADR-064 Rule 4 requires a
 * source's credential to be `organisation`-scoped, and at the time an
 * organisation-scoped credential could not be resolved without a live user
 * session — so the mandatory verify step could never pass sessionlessly.
 * openregister#450 added the sessionless `actingOrganisationId` assertion to
 * {@see CredentialBrokerService::resolveInjectable()}, and or#440 added the
 * sessionless {@see CredentialBrokerService::mint()}. The organisation guard now
 * admits a trusted in-process caller iff the asserted `actingOrganisationId`
 * equals the credential's organisation. That is exactly this migration's
 * context (OR's own mint() docblock names "an openconnector migration repair
 * step folding an inline plaintext source secret into the broker"), so the
 * executor is now implementable — and safe.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SAFETY CONTRACT (ADR-064 §6 — every line is load-bearing)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - VERIFY BEFORE NULL. A field's inline value is nulled ONLY after the minted
 *    credential resolves back to a byte-for-byte identical secret. A mint
 *    failure, a verify mismatch, a verify exception, or a save failure all leave
 *    the inline value COMPLETELY INTACT — the source keeps working exactly as
 *    before.
 *  - PER-SOURCE AND PER-FIELD ISOLATION. One field's failure never aborts the
 *    batch and never half-writes another field or source. Each field is minted,
 *    verified and saved on its own working copy, committed only on success.
 *  - ORGANISATION-SCOPED, NEVER PERSONAL. A source with no organisation is
 *    BLOCKED (never minted at `personal` scope — that would couple infrastructure
 *    to one employee and mask the missing organisation), keeping the Phase D gate
 *    closed until a human fixes it.
 *  - IDEMPOTENT. Fields already carrying a `{credentialRef}` placeholder are
 *    skipped; a second run is a no-op. Every classification is re-derived from a
 *    FRESH raw read, so concurrent progress is respected.
 *  - FAIL CLOSED ON AN OLD BROKER. If the installed OpenRegister lacks
 *    {@see CredentialBrokerService::mint()} or the 4-argument
 *    {@see CredentialBrokerService::resolveInjectable()}, the run refuses with an
 *    upgrade hint and rewrites nothing — it NEVER leaves plaintext silently.
 *  - SECRETS NEVER LOGGED. No message, context array, or exception text ever
 *    carries a secret value.
