 * silently no-ops when node_modules is absent, and never covered l10n/ anyway.
 *
 * Pluralized values (arrays) are emitted as compact JSON arrays, as on disk.

 * `observability.metrics[].name` (Prometheus metric identifiers), which made

 * translators.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS, AND HOW IT WAS ESTABLISHED
 * ---------------------------------------
 * Measured 2026-09-06 against a Nextcloud 34 instance with the user's language
 * set to `nl` and the app's `l10n/` deployed, reading the rendered DOM:
 *
 *   - `menu[].label`, recursively through `children` — Sources rendered
 *     "Bronnen", Sync runs rendered "Synchronisatieruns".
 *   - `pages[].title` — /messages/stuf rendered its heading as
 *     "StUF-berichten", not "StUF messages".
 *   - report `cards[].label` and `cards[].description` — the Reports hub
 *     rendered "StUF-berichten" and "Wat elke StUF-uitwisseling bevatte".
 *     CnReportsPage builds `resolvedCards` with `this.tr(card.label)`.
 *
 * The last two were previously excluded here, on the stated grounds that
 * CnPageRenderer "forwards [title] to the page component as a raw prop without
 * translating it". That is no longer true, and the cost of the stale exclusion
 * is not cosmetic: four live keys were reported UNUSED, and `clean:l10n`
 * proposes deleting exactly what this function fails to claim. Deleting a
 * translated page title removes the Dutch string and leaves the English source
 * rendering correctly, so nothing would have failed.
 *
 * Verify the same way before adding a field: set a user to `nl`, deploy `l10n/`
 * (the built bundle does NOT carry it), and read the DOM. A field asserted from
 * source alone is a guess.
 *
 * NOTE: `scripts/lib/l10n.js` is vendored from openregister. This function now
 * diverges beyond DYNAMIC_KEYS; openregister needs the same correction.
