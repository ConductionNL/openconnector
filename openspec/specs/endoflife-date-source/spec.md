# endoflife-date-source Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change endoflife-date-source. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: endoflife.date source preset ships enabled, credential-free

Integriq SHALL seed a pre-built `source` object with `@self.slug =
"endoflife-date"` (register `integriq`, schema `source`) on app
install/upgrade, with `location: "https://endoflife.date/api"`, `auth:
"none"`, and `isEnabled: true`. Unlike a credentialed integration preset
(e.g. `brp-haalcentraal`, `kvk`), this source SHALL ship live, not dormant,
because the upstream API is public, free, and requires no secret — there
is nothing an operator needs to configure before it can be used.

The seed SHALL be delivered as an ADR-037 register fragment
(`lib/Settings/register.d/endoflife-date-source.json`, a
`components.objects` array) so it is merged into the register descriptor
by `SettingsService` and materialised idempotently by `@self.slug` via
OpenRegister's `ImportHandler`.

#### Scenario: endoflife-date source materialises on install, already enabled

- GIVEN OpenRegister is installed and enabled
- WHEN `occ app:enable integriq` (or an upgrade) runs
  `InitializeRegister`
- THEN a `source` object with `@self.slug = "endoflife-date"` exists in
  register `integriq`, schema `source`, with `location =
  "https://endoflife.date/api"`, `auth = "none"`, and `isEnabled = true`
- @e2e exclude Backend seed materialisation — verified by PHPUnit against the OR object API, not a browser flow.

#### Scenario: seed re-import is idempotent

- GIVEN the `endoflife-date` source already exists from a prior install
- WHEN `InitializeRegister` runs again
- THEN no duplicate `endoflife-date` source is created (matched by
  `@self.slug`)
- @e2e exclude Backend idempotency — verified by PHPUnit, not a browser flow.

### Requirement: `eol_product` and `eol_cycle` schemas are declared in the existing `integriq` register

Integriq SHALL declare two new schemas — `eol_product` (a tracked
product/technology) and `eol_cycle` (one release cycle's lifecycle data for
a product) — within the existing `integriq` register (per
`openconnector-register-schema` REQ-A-001's single-register-per-app
convention), delivered as an ADR-037 register fragment declaring
`components.registers.integriq.schemas` and
`components.schemas.eol_product` / `components.schemas.eol_cycle`.

`eol_product` SHALL declare at minimum: `slug` (string, required, the
endoflife.date product identifier), `name` (string, required), `category`
(string), `homepage` (string, uri), and `endoflifeUrl` (string, uri, the
product's `https://endoflife.date/{slug}` page).

`eol_cycle` SHALL declare at minimum: `product` (string, required, the
owning `eol_product.slug`), `cycle` (string, required, the release-cycle
label, e.g. `"3.14"`), `releaseDate` (string, format date), `eol` (string
— an ISO date, or an empty string when no EOL date has been scheduled
upstream), `support` (string — same date-or-empty-string shape), `latest`
(string, the latest patch release in this cycle), `latestReleaseDate`
(string, format date), `lts` (boolean or string, per upstream's own mixed
`false`/date shape), and `discontinued` (string — same date-or-empty-string
shape as `eol`/`support`).

#### Scenario: eol_product and eol_cycle schemas are present after install

- GIVEN OpenRegister is installed and enabled
- WHEN `occ app:enable integriq` (or an upgrade) runs
  `InitializeRegister`
- THEN `components.schemas.eol_product` and `components.schemas.eol_cycle`
  exist in the merged register descriptor, both listed under register
  `integriq`'s `schemas` array
- AND no second, separate OpenRegister register is created for them
- @e2e exclude Backend register materialisation — verified by PHPUnit against the OR object API, not a browser flow.

#### Scenario: eol_cycle schema covers the brief's required fields

- GIVEN the `eol_cycle` schema in the merged register descriptor
- WHEN inspecting `properties`
- THEN `product`, `cycle`, `releaseDate`, `eol`, `support`, `latest`, and
  `lts` are all present, matching the field list a consuming app needs to
  match a catalog module's version against its EOL window
- @e2e exclude Schema-shape assertion — verified by PHPUnit/JSON fixture, not a browser flow.

### Requirement: a curated starter set of tracked products is seeded declaratively

Integriq SHALL seed one `eol_product` object per curated starter
product — `php`, `nodejs`, `python`, `postgresql`, `mysql`, `nextcloud`,
`wordpress`, `laravel` — as static catalog metadata (register
`integriq`, schema `eol_product`, keyed by `@self.slug`). These
objects SHALL be seeded declaratively, not populated by a synchronization
run, because their metadata (name, category, homepage) is static and does
not need to be fetched from `/api/all.json` (which returns a bare array of
product-slug strings, not the object-shaped list the generic
Synchronization engine's per-item identity/mapping pipeline requires —
see this change's design.md discovery notes for the underlying finding).

#### Scenario: all eight curated eol_product objects exist after install

- GIVEN OpenRegister is installed and enabled
- WHEN `occ app:enable integriq` (or an upgrade) runs
  `InitializeRegister`
- THEN `eol_product` objects with `@self.slug` of `php`, `nodejs`, `python`,
  `postgresql`, `mysql`, `nextcloud`, `wordpress`, and `laravel` all exist
  in register `integriq`, schema `eol_product`
- @e2e exclude Backend seed materialisation — verified by PHPUnit against the OR object API, not a browser flow.

#### Scenario: extending the tracked set requires no code change

- GIVEN an operator wants to track a ninth product listed at
  `https://endoflife.date/api/all.json` (e.g. `django`)
- WHEN they follow the documented recipe (docs page) — duplicating one
  curated product's `eol_product` seed object plus its `mapping` /
  `synchronization` / `job` triple, substituting the new product slug —
  and re-run `InitializeRegister`
- THEN the new product's `eol_cycle` data begins syncing on the same daily
  cadence, with no PHP or engine change required
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API

### Requirement: each curated product syncs its cycles via a dedicated, engine-native Synchronization

For each curated product, Integriq SHALL seed one `mapping` object,
one `synchronization` object, and one `job` object (register
`integriq`), reusing the existing Synchronization/Mapping/Job engine
unchanged:

- The `synchronization` object SHALL set `sourceId: "endoflife-date"`,
  `sourceType: "api"`, `sourceConfig.endpoint: "/{slug}.json"` (a literal,
  non-templated path — e.g. `/python.json` for the `python` product),
  `sourceConfig.resultsPosition: "_root"` (REQUIRED — the endpoint's JSON
  body is a bare top-level array with none of the fallback `items`/
  `result`/`results` keys the engine otherwise looks for; omitting this
  field causes every run to fail with "Cannot determine the position of
  objects in the return body"), `sourceConfig.idPosition: "cycle"`,
  `targetType: "register/schema"`, `targetId: "integriq/eol_cycle"`,
  and `sourceTargetMapping` set to that product's seeded `mapping` slug.
- The `mapping` object SHALL map each fetched cycle's `cycle`,
  `releaseDate`, `eol`, `support`, `latest`, `latestReleaseDate`, and `lts`
  fields by direct dot-path copy, SHALL set `product` to a literal string
  equal to the product's slug (e.g. `"python"` — a plain literal renders
  verbatim through the mapping engine's Twig step since it contains no
  `{{ }}` markers), and SHALL cast `eol`, `support`, and `discontinued` to
  `string` so upstream's mixed date-or-`false` shape lands as a single,
  consistently-typed column (an ISO date string, or an empty string when
  no date is scheduled).
- The `job` object SHALL set `jobClass:
  "OCA\\Integriq\\Action\\SynchronizationAction"`,
  `arguments.synchronizationId` to that product's `synchronization` slug,
  `interval: 86400` (daily), and `isEnabled: true` — the existing, generic
  job-dispatch mechanism (`job-scheduling` REQ-003/REQ-004); no new job
  class is introduced.

Each curated product's `synchronization` object is independent —
distinct `synchronizationId`s so that `SynchronizationContract` identity
(scoped to `(synchronizationId, originId)`) can never collide two
different products' same-labelled cycles onto the same target object.

#### Scenario: a scheduled run fetches, maps, and upserts one product's cycles

- GIVEN the seeded `endoflife-date-python-cycles` job is due
- WHEN the cron sweep (`job-scheduling` REQ-003/REQ-004) executes it
- THEN `SynchronizationAction::run()` resolves the
  `endoflife-date-python-cycles` synchronization and calls
  `SynchronizationService::synchronize()`
- AND a single GET request is made to
  `https://endoflife.date/api/python.json`
- AND each returned cycle is mapped via the
  `endoflife-date-python-cycles-mapping` mapping and upserted as an
  `eol_cycle` object with `product = "python"`
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API

#### Scenario: two curated products never collide on cycle identity

- GIVEN the `python` and `nodejs` products both happen to report a cycle
  labelled `"20"` (or any other coincidentally-shared label)
- WHEN both products' scheduled syncs run
- THEN two distinct `eol_cycle` objects exist — one with `product =
  "python"`, one with `product = "nodejs"` — because each product's sync
  uses a distinct `synchronizationId`, so their `SynchronizationContract`s
  (keyed on `(synchronizationId, originId)`) never collide
- AND neither product's cycle data overwrites the other's
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API

### Requirement: repeated syncs upsert idempotently and garbage-collect soft-deleted cycles

Re-running a product's seeded synchronization SHALL NOT create a
duplicate `eol_cycle` object for a cycle label already synced — the
existing `SynchronizationContract` origin-id/hash mechanism
(`synchronization-engine` REQ-003/REQ-004) SHALL update the existing
target object in place when the source content is unchanged (no-op write)
or changed (updated write), reused unmodified. A cycle no longer reported
by the source SHALL be garbage-collected via the existing
`deleteInvalidObjects()` path — which is soft-delete-aware per
OpenRegister's standard delete semantics — subject to the existing
fetch-completeness and deletion-ratio guards (`synchronization-engine`
REQ-009/REQ-010). Each curated product's `synchronization` object SHALL
set `sourceConfig.deletionRatioThreshold: 0.5` (raised from the engine's
`0.10` default) because several curated products have a small total cycle
count, where retiring even one legitimately-removed cycle can exceed the
default 10% guard and block correct cleanup.

#### Scenario: re-running the same sync produces no duplicate objects

- GIVEN a product's synchronization has already run once, producing N
  `eol_cycle` objects
- WHEN the same synchronization runs again with unchanged source data
- THEN the same N `eol_cycle` objects exist afterward (no duplicates, no
  new objects created)
- @e2e exclude Backend idempotency — verified by the live smoke test and PHPUnit, not a browser flow.

#### Scenario: a retired cycle is garbage-collected within the raised deletion-ratio guard

- GIVEN a product's synchronization has 4 existing `eol_cycle` contracts
  and the source's next complete fetch no longer reports 1 of them (25%
  of the existing contracts)
- WHEN the synchronization runs
- THEN the now-absent cycle's `eol_cycle` object is deleted (25% is within
  the raised `0.5` threshold, so the deletion-ratio guard does not block
  it — whereas the engine's unmodified `0.10` default would have)
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API

#### Scenario: an incomplete fetch never triggers deletion

- GIVEN a product's synchronization run's fetch is marked incomplete
  (`synchronization-engine` REQ-009 — e.g. a non-2xx page response)
- WHEN `deleteInvalidObjects()` would otherwise run
- THEN no `eol_cycle` object is deleted for that run, unchanged
  `synchronization-engine` REQ-010 behaviour
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API

### Requirement: the preset is automatically visible on the Catalog page

The `endoflife-date` source SHALL become visible as a `source-template`
card on Integriq's Catalog page purely as a side effect of this
change's register fragment seeding a `source` object — the existing
`CatalogRegistryService.collectFromSeedFragments()` mechanism
(`connector-catalog` REQ-003) already content-inspects every
`register.d/*.json` fragment for a `source` object and materialises a
matching catalog card. This change SHALL NOT add any bespoke Catalog UI
wiring, controller, or frontend code.

#### Scenario: endoflife-date appears on the Catalog page without new UI code

- GIVEN the `endoflife-date` source seed fragment is installed
- WHEN an operator opens the Catalog page
- THEN a card for "endoflife.date" is rendered among the source-template
  entries, with a status badge reading "available" (the source ships
  `isEnabled: true`, no mock/dormant gating applies)
- @e2e exclude Existing Catalog rendering mechanism — covered by connector-catalog's own e2e/PHPUnit coverage; this change adds no new render path to test.

### Requirement: a live smoke test proves the preset against the real public API

Integriq SHALL ship an integration test
(`tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`) that dispatches a real,
unmocked HTTP request against `https://endoflife.date/api` and asserts:
(1) a full synchronization run for at least one curated product produces
the expected `eol_cycle` objects with `product`, `cycle`, and `eol`
populated; and (2) re-running the same synchronization is idempotent (no
duplicate objects, per the requirement above). Following the repo's
established `tests/Integration` convention (already excluded from the
default `phpunit.xml` `Unit Tests` suite; run via `phpunit-unit.xml
--testsuite "Integration Tests"`), the test SHALL self-skip — not fail —
when the real endpoint is unreachable (a short-timeout connectivity probe)
or when `INTEGRIQ_SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS=1` is set, so it never blocks a
network-isolated CI run.

#### Scenario: the live smoke test passes against the real API when network is available

- GIVEN a test environment with outbound internet access
- WHEN `vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-unit.xml --testsuite "Integration Tests" --filter EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest` runs
- THEN a real HTTP call is made to `https://endoflife.date/api/{product}.json`
  for at least one curated product
- AND at least one `eol_cycle` object is created with a non-empty `cycle`
  value
- AND running the same synchronization a second time produces no
  additional `eol_cycle` objects for that product
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API

#### Scenario: the live smoke test self-skips without network access

- GIVEN a network-isolated test environment (or
  `INTEGRIQ_SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS=1`)
- WHEN the same test runs
- THEN the test reports as skipped, not failed, and the overall test suite
  exit code is unaffected by the missing network access
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Integration/EndoflifeDateLiveSyncTest.php`, which reaches the real endoflife.date API and self-skips without network. A browser session neither runs the scheduled job nor reaches that API


### Requirement: the two schema slugs are snake_case, and an existing install is renamed in place

The endoflife.date schemas SHALL be declared as `eol_product` and `eol_cycle`.
They were `eolProduct` and `eolCycle`, the only two camelCase slugs among the
fifty-five this app declares, which made their object URLs the only ones an
operator could not guess from the pattern the other fifty-three follow.

An install that already holds the camelCase rows SHALL have them renamed in
place by the `MigrateEolSchemaSlugs` repair step, which MUST run before
`InitializeRegister`. Renaming the fragment alone is not sufficient and is not
safe: `ImportHandler` matches an incoming schema by its `slug` and never by the
dict key it is filed under, so an import that finds no match CREATES a second
schema and leaves the original row, its magic table and its eight seeded objects
stranded, because the import unions schema ids into the register and never
removes one.

The rename SHALL also re-point the stored `integriq/eolCycle` strings a
synchronization holds in `source_id`/`target_id`, which is the one place a
schema slug is written into data rather than referenced by id. The step SHALL be
idempotent, SHALL refuse rather than merge when both the old and the new slug
exist, and SHALL never throw.

#### Scenario: an existing install keeps its objects across the rename

- GIVEN an install whose register holds `eolProduct` with its eight seeded
  product objects and `eolCycle` with whatever cycles have been synced
- WHEN the app is upgraded
- THEN both schema rows carry the snake_case slug
- AND every object, magic table and register link is unchanged, because an
  object binds to its schema by numeric id and the shard tables are named from
  ids, so no slug appears anywhere in the physical layout
- AND the eight endoflife-date synchronizations address `integriq/eol_cycle`
- @e2e exclude a repair step runs at `occ upgrade` and nowhere else, so no browser session can reach it. The decision table is covered by `tests/Unit/Repair/MigrateEolSchemaSlugsTest.php`; the in-place rename itself was verified against a live instance by reading the schema rows and the synchronizations' `target_id` back before and after.

#### Scenario: a second upgrade plans nothing

- GIVEN an install whose schemas already carry the snake_case slugs
- WHEN the app is upgraded again
- THEN the step reports nothing renamed and nothing refused
- AND no schema is created, deleted or merged
- @e2e exclude same reason as above. Idempotence is asserted directly in `tests/Unit/Repair/MigrateEolSchemaSlugsTest.php`.
