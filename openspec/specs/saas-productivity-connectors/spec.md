# saas-productivity-connectors Specification

## Purpose

SaaS productivity vendors (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Slack, Jira,
Salesforce, Exact Online, etc.) register as `IntegrationProvider`s under
`lib/Service/Adapter/Saas/`, each extending the shared
`AbstractCategoryAdapterProvider` (`lib/Service/Adapter/AbstractCategoryAdapterProvider.php`).
`Microsoft365Adapter` (`lib/Service/Adapter/Saas/Microsoft365Adapter.php`) is
the reference implementation, proving `calendar-read` and
`mail-metadata-read` against Microsoft Graph's `me` surface (deliberately
scoped to metadata reads only — no send/write capability, no message-body
access). To add the next vendor: create a new class extending
`AbstractCategoryAdapterProvider`, implement the `IntegrationProvider`
metadata methods plus vendor-specific read methods via `brokeredRequest()`,
and register it in `Application::registerIntegrationProviders()`. The
remaining named vendors stay explicit backlog (see
`openspec/changes/connector-category-adapter-scaffolding`).

## Requirements
### Requirement: SaaS productivity and work-management connector adapters SHALL register through the integration registry per ADR-019 (REQ-SPC-001)

SaaS productivity and work-management connector adapters MUST register through
the integration registry per ADR-019.
Every adapter for a SaaS productivity, communication, work
management, ITSM, CRM, or NL/EU ERP platform — Microsoft 365
(Outlook + Calendar + Teams + Sharepoint metadata),
Google Workspace (Gmail + Calendar + Tasks + Drive metadata),
Slack, Microsoft Teams, Notion, Asana, ClickUp, Monday.com,
Atlassian Jira, Atlassian Confluence, ServiceNow, Salesforce,
HubSpot, Zendesk, plus NL/EU-specific Exact Online, Twinfield,
AFAS, Unit4, e-Boekhouden, MoneyBird — MUST be implemented as
an `IntegrationProvider` registered through OR's integration
registry per ADR-019. Adapter classes MUST live under
`lib/Service/Adapter/Saas/`.

Where a sibling Conduction app already provides equivalent
functionality (e.g. **shillinq for bookkeeping**), the SPC
adapter is the *bridge* to the external SaaS, not a replacement
for the Conduction-side capability. Per ADR-022, sibling apps
consume the SaaS bridge by slug; they do NOT carry their own
HTTP client to the SaaS vendor.

#### Scenario: Reviewer confirms no per-app SaaS SDK in sibling apps

- **GIVEN** any sibling app's `lib/Service/` tree
- **WHEN** scanned for direct imports of
  `Microsoft\\Graph\\*`, `Google\\Service\\*`,
  `JoliCode\\Slack\\*`, `Salesforce\\*`, `ServiceNow\\*`,
  `Atlassian\\*`, `Notion\\*`, `Twinfield\\*`, `Exact\\*`,
  `Afas\\*`
- **THEN** no such imports SHALL exist; SaaS access MUST route
  through integriq by integration slot slug.
- @e2e exclude a review checklist, not a behaviour. It asks a REVIEWER to confirm something about SIBLING APPS' source, which is neither a DOM behaviour nor even a fact about this repository

### Requirement: Each SPC adapter manifest entry SHALL declare a fixed capability vocabulary across record-crud, event-subscribe, search-lookup, and bulk operations (REQ-SPC-002)

Each SPC adapter manifest entry MUST declare a fixed capability vocabulary.
Per ADR-024 (extending the REQ-DIC-002 manifest shape), every
SPC adapter MUST publish a manifest entry with
`category: saas-productivity`, an explicit `subCategory` of
one of `email-calendar`, `chat-collab`, `work-management`,
`itsm`, `crm`, `helpdesk`, `erp`, `accounting`, `hr-payroll`,
and a `capabilities[]` drawn from the canonical vocabulary:

| Capability | Meaning | Typical scope |
|---|---|---|
| `record-crud` | Create, read, update, delete records on a configured remote entity (Jira issue, Salesforce account, Asana task, Exact transaction) | per remote entity type, declared in the source configuration |
| `record-versioning` | Read change history for a record | per entity type, where the upstream supports it |
| `event-subscribe` | Subscribe to remote change events via webhook | normalised to CloudEvent (per REQ-SPC-005) |
| `search-lookup` | Federated record/document/contact search | normalised hit envelope (per REQ-SPC-004) |
| `bulk-export` | Bulk read of a remote entity into a local register (mappings via OR `Mapping` abstraction) | scheduled via OR `ScheduledWorkflow` |
| `bulk-import` | Bulk write of local records to the remote system | requires explicit operator opt-in per REQ-SPC-006 |
| `oauth-userlevel` | The adapter supports per-user OAuth tokens (in addition to the operator-level Source-stored credentials) | required for "send as the user" patterns |
| `presence` | Read user presence (free/busy / available / dnd) | chat/calendar adapters |
| `attachment-fetch` | Fetch file attachments referenced from records — bytes pass-through only; persistence MUST go through docudesk per REQ-SPC-007 |

Capabilities a given SaaS does not support MUST be omitted. The
manifest validator MUST reject any unknown capability literal.

#### Scenario: A Jira adapter declares the right capability subset

- **GIVEN** the Jira adapter manifest entry
- **WHEN** inspected
- **THEN** `capabilities[]` SHALL include `record-crud`,
- @e2e exclude the adapter this names does not exist. Verified 2026-09-07: each connector family ships exactly ONE reference adapter (Saas: Microsoft365Adapter, DocumentCms: SharePointOnlineAdapter, EndpointWorkspace: AzureVirtualDesktopAdapter, DataInfra: S3Adapter), and no file under lib/ carries the adapter named here. The scenario is forward-looking rather than unmet
  `record-versioning`, `event-subscribe`, `search-lookup`,
  `bulk-export`, `attachment-fetch`; MAY include
  `oauth-userlevel`; MUST NOT include `presence`.

#### Scenario: An Exact Online adapter declares accounting-shaped capabilities

- **GIVEN** the Exact Online adapter manifest entry
- **WHEN** inspected
- **THEN** `subCategory` SHALL equal `accounting`;
- @e2e exclude the adapter this names does not exist. Verified 2026-09-07: each connector family ships exactly ONE reference adapter (Saas: Microsoft365Adapter, DocumentCms: SharePointOnlineAdapter, EndpointWorkspace: AzureVirtualDesktopAdapter, DataInfra: S3Adapter), and no file under lib/ carries the adapter named here. The scenario is forward-looking rather than unmet
  `capabilities[]` SHALL include `record-crud` for bookings /
  invoices / contacts, `bulk-export`, `bulk-import` (opt-in
  per REQ-SPC-006), `attachment-fetch`.

### Requirement: OAuth 2.0 SHALL be the default auth mode; service-account JWT and API key are explicit alternates only (REQ-SPC-003)

Per ADR-005 (security), SPC adapters MUST default to OAuth 2.0
authorization-code flow with PKCE. The OAuth flow MUST be
hosted by integriq — no sibling app MUST open an OAuth
browser window, hold an OAuth client secret, or refresh tokens.
Per ADR-019 §"External integrations route through Integriq",
the integriq source is the canonical credential home.

The manifest entry's `authModes[]` MUST list `oauth2` first
when supported, and MAY include the alternate auth modes
`serviceAccountJwt` (where the SaaS supports server-to-server
JWT — e.g. Google Workspace domain-wide delegation) and
`apiKey` (legacy alternates — e.g. some Exact / Twinfield
configurations, MoneyBird). `basicAuth` MUST NOT appear in
new SPC adapters; legacy basic-auth adapters MUST be flagged
in the manifest entry with `"deprecated": true` and an ADR-005
exception reference.

When the adapter supports `oauth-userlevel` per REQ-SPC-002,
per-user token storage MUST also live in integriq via the
existing `Source` extension for per-user credentials; sibling
apps reference the per-user token by NC user id + source slug,
they MUST NOT cache the token themselves.

#### Scenario: Reviewer confirms no OAuth client secret in any sibling app

- **GIVEN** any sibling app's repository
- **WHEN** scanned for substrings `client_secret`,
  `client-secret`, `oauth_client`, or for environment-variable
  references like `*_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env` examples
  or appinfo/info.xml descriptions
- **THEN** no such references SHALL exist; OAuth client
  credentials live only in integriq source records.
- @e2e exclude a review checklist, not a behaviour. It asks a REVIEWER to confirm something about SIBLING APPS' source, which is neither a DOM behaviour nor even a fact about this repository

#### Scenario: A SaaS source supports OAuth as the default auth mode

- **GIVEN** a newly added Slack adapter
- **WHEN** the manifest entry is inspected
- **THEN** `authModes[0]` SHALL equal `oauth2`; the entry MAY
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session
  also list `apiKey` for legacy bot-token compatibility.

### Requirement: Search/lookup federation SHALL share the document-cms hit envelope, extended with `entityType`, `recordKey`, and `actorLabel` for record-shaped hits (REQ-SPC-004)

A federated search across multiple SaaS sources MUST return
the REQ-DCC-004 normalised hit envelope, extended with two
fields for record-shaped hits (Jira issues, Asana tasks,
Salesforce accounts, Notion pages, ServiceNow tickets):

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `entityType` | string | The remote entity kind (`jira-issue`, `asana-task`, `salesforce-account`, etc.) |
| `recordKey` | string | The remote system's human-readable key (e.g. `PROJ-1234`, `OPP-5678`) |
| `actorLabel` | string or null | Best-available "owner" label for the record (assignee, owner, last-modified-by) |

Per ADR-022, the normalisation logic lives in integriq;
sibling apps consume only the envelope shape. The federation
MUST allow mixed-category queries (DCC + SPC + EWC results
in one query) — `sourceSlug` distinguishes the source and the
optional `entityType` distinguishes the kind.

#### Scenario: A federated search returns mixed DCC + SPC hits

- **GIVEN** operator-configured SharePoint (DCC) and Jira (SPC)
  sources
- **WHEN** a sibling app issues a federated search for
  `"customer onboarding"`
- **THEN** every hit MUST conform to the envelope; SharePoint
  hits MUST omit `entityType` / `recordKey`; Jira hits MUST
  include `entityType: jira-issue` and `recordKey: <PROJ-NNN>`;
  the caller MUST be able to merge-sort by `score`.
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session

### Requirement: Event subscriptions SHALL normalise to CloudEvents and route through the standard event dispatcher per ADR-022 (REQ-SPC-005)

Event subscriptions MUST normalise to CloudEvents and route through the
standard event dispatcher per ADR-022.
Per REQ-EWC-004 (same shape across the connector-categories
family) and ADR-022 §"Events + webhooks", inbound webhook
events from SaaS sources MUST be normalised to CloudEvents of
type `com.conduction.saas.<sub-category>.<event-kind>` (e.g.
`com.conduction.saas.work-management.issue-status-changed`,
`com.conduction.saas.crm.opportunity-stage-changed`,
`com.conduction.saas.chat-collab.message-mentioned`).

Integriq MUST NOT author a new event table for SPC
events — every event lands in the existing `CallLog` (for
raw transport audit) and in the CloudEvent dispatcher (for
sibling-app reaction). Sibling apps subscribe through the
standard CloudEvent contract; persistence for long-term
retention is the sibling app's choice and MUST go through OR's
audit-trail-immutable per ADR-022.

#### Scenario: A Jira issue-status webhook reaches a sibling app via CloudEvent

- **GIVEN** a Jira source declaring `event-subscribe`
- **WHEN** Jira POSTs an issue-updated webhook
- **THEN** integriq MUST normalise to a CloudEvent of type
- @e2e exclude the adapter this names does not exist. Verified 2026-09-07: each connector family ships exactly ONE reference adapter (Saas: Microsoft365Adapter, DocumentCms: SharePointOnlineAdapter, EndpointWorkspace: AzureVirtualDesktopAdapter, DataInfra: S3Adapter), and no file under lib/ carries the adapter named here. The scenario is forward-looking rather than unmet
  `com.conduction.saas.work-management.issue-status-changed`;
  any subscribed sibling app MUST receive it; no SPC-specific
  event table SHALL be created in integriq.

### Requirement: Mutative bulk operations SHALL be opt-in per source AND gated by an admin-configured action authorisation per ADR-023 (REQ-SPC-006)

Mutative bulk operations MUST be opt-in per source AND gated by an
admin-configured action authorisation per ADR-023.
Per REQ-EWC-005 (same shape across the family) and the
in-flight ADR-023, every mutative bulk operation against a SaaS
source — `bulk-import`, any `record-crud` invoked through a
scheduled workflow rather than a user-initiated request — MUST
be:

1. Opt-in per `Source` record via an explicit
   `enabledMutativeBulkActions: string[]` configuration field;
   omitting the action name MUST cause the adapter to throw
   `MutativeBulkActionDisabledException` on invocation.
2. Gated by an admin-configured action-to-group mapping per
   ADR-023 — the integriq admin settings MUST list the
   bulk action and let the operator bind it to a Nextcloud
   group; the adapter MUST verify membership at invocation
   time.
3. Logged to the existing `CallLog` with outcome
   `mutative-bulk-invoked` regardless of success/failure.

#### Scenario: A `bulk-import` rejected because not opted in

- **GIVEN** a Salesforce source with
  `enabledMutativeBulkActions: []` (default)
- **WHEN** any caller invokes `bulkImport(...)`
- **THEN** the call MUST throw
  `MutativeBulkActionDisabledException`; **AND** an audit row
  MUST land in `CallLog`.
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session

### Requirement: Attachment bytes MUST stream through the adapter without local persistence; long-term storage SHALL go through docudesk per ADR-022 (REQ-SPC-007)

Attachment bytes MUST stream through the adapter without local persistence;
long-term storage MUST go through docudesk per ADR-022.
Per REQ-DCC-006 (same shape across the family), when an SPC
adapter exposes `attachment-fetch`, the bytes MUST be returned
as a stream to the caller without local persistence in
integriq. Sibling apps that need to retain the attachment
MUST route it to docudesk's file API per ADR-022. Integriq
MUST NOT write attachment bytes to its app data directory or to
any integriq-owned table.

#### Scenario: A workflow stores a Jira attachment as a docudesk file

- **GIVEN** a workflow that fetches a Jira issue's attachment
  via the adapter
- **WHEN** the workflow persists the file
- **THEN** the file bytes MUST be POSTed to docudesk; the OR
  object that references the attachment MUST carry a docudesk
  URI; no file bytes SHALL be written under integriq's
  app data or any integriq-owned table.
- @e2e exclude the adapter this names does not exist. Verified 2026-09-07: each connector family ships exactly ONE reference adapter (Saas: Microsoft365Adapter, DocumentCms: SharePointOnlineAdapter, EndpointWorkspace: AzureVirtualDesktopAdapter, DataInfra: S3Adapter), and no file under lib/ carries the adapter named here. The scenario is forward-looking rather than unmet

### Requirement: Individual per-vendor adapters are explicitly out of scope for this spec — each adapter MUST ship in its own `add-openconnector-{slug}-adapter` change (REQ-SPC-008)

Individual per-vendor SPC adapter implementations MUST be out of scope for this spec.
Per REQ-DIC-007 / REQ-DCC-007 / REQ-EWC-007, individual SPC
adapter implementations (e.g. Microsoft 365, Google Workspace,
Slack, Teams, Jira, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Exact Online,
Twinfield, AFAS, Unit4, MoneyBird) MUST land as separate
openspec changes. Per-adapter changes MUST cite REQ-SPC-001
through REQ-SPC-007 and MUST NOT re-derive the category-level
contract.

#### Scenario: A new Microsoft 365 adapter change references this spec

- **GIVEN** a new change folder
  `openspec/changes/add-openconnector-microsoft365-adapter/`
- **WHEN** its proposal.md is inspected
- **THEN** the `Depends on` line MUST include
  `saas-productivity-connectors (integriq)`; the proposal
  MUST cite REQ-SPC-002 (capabilities), REQ-SPC-003 (OAuth
  default), REQ-SPC-005 (CloudEvent normalisation),
  REQ-SPC-006 (bulk-action authorisation), and REQ-SPC-007
  (attachments via docudesk) by REQ id.
- @e2e exclude a process rule for FUTURE changes: it asks that a not-yet-written change reference this spec. There is nothing to drive until that change exists
