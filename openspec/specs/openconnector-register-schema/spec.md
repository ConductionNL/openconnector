# openconnector-register-schema Specification

## Purpose
Declare the Integriq data model as a single OpenRegister register descriptor
(`lib/Settings/integriq_register.json`), replacing the implicit data model
encoded across 15 hand-maintained `oc_openconnector_*` tables and their mappers
with one authoritative OpenAPI 3.0 + `x-openregister` document. This declaration
is the platform-neutral source of truth from which the companion code chain
(`openconnector-register-storage`) provisions storage and migrates data. Aligns
with ADR-001, ADR-031, and ADR-032. Status: implemented.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Register descriptor file MUST exist at the canonical path (REQ-A-001)

The system MUST ship a register descriptor file at
`lib/Settings/integriq_register.json` that conforms to OpenAPI 3.0 with the
`x-openregister` vendor extension. The file MUST declare exactly one register
with slug `openconnector` and a non-empty `schemas` array referencing every
schema defined in `components.schemas`.

#### Scenario: Descriptor file present at canonical path

- **GIVEN** a fresh checkout of the integriq repo
- **WHEN** inspecting `integriq/lib/Settings/`
- **THEN** `integriq_register.json` MUST exist
- **AND** it MUST parse as valid JSON
- **AND** its top-level keys MUST be exactly `openapi`, `info`, `x-openregister`,
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page
  `components`

#### Scenario: Register slug is openconnector

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07: the register slug is `integriq`. The 2026-08 rename moved it, and OpenRegister register slugs are frozen once data is written, so this is the new canonical value. Left visible rather than annotated, because a waiver would record coverage for a claim that is no longer true.

- **GIVEN** the descriptor file is loaded
- **WHEN** inspecting `components.registers`
- **THEN** exactly one register entry MUST exist with slug `openconnector`
- **AND** its `schemas` array MUST list all 21 schema slugs
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

### Requirement: Log schemas MUST be declared append-only and immutable (REQ-A-003)

Every log schema in the descriptor MUST set `appendOnly: true` AND `immutable: true` at the schema level.

The four log schemas (`call_log`, `job_log`, `synchronization_log`,
`synchronization_contract_log`) MUST declare both `appendOnly: true` and
`immutable: true` at the schema level. The 11 mutable config schemas MUST set
both flags to `false` (or omit them — OR defaults to false).

#### Scenario: Log schemas marked append-only and immutable
- GIVEN the descriptor declares 4 log schemas
- WHEN inspecting each log schema's top-level flags
- THEN `appendOnly` MUST be `true`
- AND `immutable` MUST be `true`
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

#### Scenario: Config schemas remain mutable
- GIVEN the descriptor declares 11 mutable config schemas
- WHEN inspecting each config schema's top-level flags
- THEN `appendOnly` MUST be `false` or absent
- AND `immutable` MUST be `false` or absent
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

### Requirement: Log schemas MUST carry retention annotation (REQ-A-004)

Each of the 4 log schemas MUST carry an `x-openregister-archival` annotation
encoding the retention window. Success-path log retention MUST default to
`PT1H` (one hour, matching `JobService::DEFAULT_SUCCESS_LOG_RETENTION = 3600000`
ms / 1000 = 3600 s). Error-path log retention MUST default to `P30D` (30 days,
matching `DEFAULT_ERROR_LOG_RETENTION = 2592000000` ms). The annotation MUST be
shaped so that OR's archival workflow can drive both windows; the exact
attribute names follow OR's `archival-destruction-workflow` spec.

#### Scenario: call_log carries split retention
- GIVEN the `call_log` schema in the descriptor
- WHEN inspecting `x-openregister-archival`
- THEN it MUST encode a retention rule with `PT1H` for success-class entries
- AND `P30D` for error-class entries
- AND the discriminator field (e.g. `statusCode >= 400` or a `level`-based rule)
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page
  MUST be expressed as part of the annotation

### Requirement: Integer foreign-key columns MUST be relation-annotated (REQ-A-005)

Each integer foreign-key column on an integriq entity MUST be re-declared in
the schema as a UUID property paired with a `$ref` to the target schema. The
following 6 relations MUST exist:

| Source schema   | Property name | $ref target          | Cardinality | onDelete   |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|
| `call_log`      | `source`      | `source`             | many-to-one | SET NULL   |
| `call_log`      | `synchronization` | `synchronization` | many-to-one | SET NULL   |
| `event_message` | `event`       | `event`              | many-to-one | CASCADE    |
| `event_message` | `consumer`    | `consumer`           | many-to-one | SET NULL   |
| `event_message` | `subscription`| `event_subscription` | many-to-one | CASCADE    |
| `synchronization_contract_log` | `synchronization_contract` | `synchronization_contract` | many-to-one | CASCADE |

The legacy `*Id` column name (e.g. `sourceId`, `eventId`) MUST be retained as a
sibling property to support the transition window described in REQ-008. The
existing string-typed FKs (`synchronizationId`, `synchronizationContractId`,
`synchronizationLogId`, `jobId`) MUST also be re-declared with the equivalent
relation annotation on the target-schema-named field.

#### Scenario: call_log has both legacy and relation fields for source
- GIVEN the `call_log` schema in the descriptor
- WHEN inspecting `properties.source` and `properties.sourceId`
- THEN `source` MUST exist with `type: "string"`, `format: "uuid"`, `$ref: "source"`
- AND `sourceId` MUST exist with `type: "integer"` (legacy)
- AND both properties MUST have an explanatory `description` field
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

#### Scenario: event_message has cascade-delete on event subscription
- GIVEN the `event_message` schema in the descriptor
- WHEN inspecting `properties.subscription`
- THEN it MUST carry `$ref: "event_subscription"` and `onDelete: "CASCADE"`
- AND its `description` MUST state cascade behaviour explicitly
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

### Requirement: Synchronization sourceId/targetId MUST remain string-typed with overload documented (REQ-A-006)

The `synchronization.sourceId` and `synchronization.targetId` properties MUST be declared as `type: "string"` with no `$ref`, and their description MUST document the three valid value formats.

`synchronization.sourceId` and `synchronization.targetId` are overloaded —
they may carry an integer Source PK string-encoded, a `register/schema`
slug-pair, or a UUID. The schema MUST declare them as `type: "string"` with
NO `$ref`, and the `description` MUST enumerate the three valid value formats
and direct callers to `lib/Service/SynchronizationService.php` for resolution
logic.

#### Scenario: synchronization.sourceId is documented overload
- GIVEN the `synchronization` schema in the descriptor
- WHEN inspecting `properties.sourceId`
- THEN `type` MUST be `"string"`
- AND `$ref` MUST be absent
- AND `description` MUST mention "integer PK", "register/schema slug-pair", and "uuid"
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

### Requirement: Seed data file MUST exist for mutable schemas only (REQ-A-007)

The system MUST ship `lib/Settings/integriq_seed_data.json` containing
3–5 seed objects per mutable config schema. The file MUST be a JSON object keyed
by schema slug; each value MUST be an array of object literals carrying the
`@self` envelope (`register`, `schema`, `slug`). Log schemas MUST NOT appear in
the seed data file.

Seed objects MUST use safe placeholder values for any secret-bearing column
(`apikey`, `password`, `secret`, `jwt`, `authenticationConfig`). Examples:
`"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`, `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`,
`"<placeholder>"`.

#### Scenario: Seed file contains only mutable schemas
- GIVEN `integriq_seed_data.json` is loaded
- WHEN inspecting the top-level keys
- THEN they MUST be a subset of the 11 mutable schema slugs
- AND `call_log`, `job_log`, `synchronization_log`,
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page
  `synchronization_contract_log` MUST NOT appear

#### Scenario: Source seed objects use safe placeholder credentials
- GIVEN seed entries for the `source` schema
- WHEN inspecting `apikey`, `password`, `secret` fields
- THEN values MUST be one of `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`, `"<placeholder>"`, or an
  obviously non-credential string
- AND values MUST NOT resemble real Bearer tokens, JWT tokens, or hex/base64
  secrets of plausible length
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

### Requirement: Descriptor MUST be backwards-compatible with legacy field names (REQ-A-008)

During the transition window, the descriptor MUST permit reads from both the
legacy `*Id` integer fields and the new target-schema-named string fields. The
storage chain populates both; the field-rename cleanup is deferred to a
follow-up change. The descriptor MUST NOT remove a legacy field without a
matching ADDED/REMOVED entry in a future change.

#### Scenario: Legacy field present alongside relation field
- GIVEN any schema with an FK relation declared per REQ-005
- WHEN inspecting both the relation field and the legacy `*Id` field
- THEN both MUST be present in `properties`
- AND both fields MUST NOT appear in the schema's `required` array (they are optional during the transition)
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

### Requirement: All 21 schemas MUST be declared (REQ-A-002)

The system MUST declare at least 21 schemas in `components.schemas`. The
mutable config schemas this requirement enumerates are: `source`, `consumer`,
`endpoint`, `event`, `event_message`, `event_subscription`, `job`, `mapping`,
`rule`, `synchronization`, `synchronization_contract`, `ris_sync_record`,
`peppol_transmission`, `lti_platform`, `lti_tool`, `lti_deployment`,
`lti_identity_link` (17 total; `ris_sync_record` and `peppol_transmission`
predate the `lti-13-platform` change and were previously uncounted here —
reconciled while adding the three LTI schemas; `lti_identity_link` is new in
this change, REQ-LTI-012). The append-only log schemas are: `call_log`,
`job_log`, `synchronization_log`, `synchronization_contract_log` (4 total,
unchanged by this change).

Note: the live descriptor at HEAD carries additional mutable schemas beyond
this list (e.g. `bankfeed_batch`, `dso_message`, `fsc_call`,
`iwmo_ijw_message`, `kiss_klantcontact`, `openformulieren_submission`,
`payment_intent`, `sms_message`, `zgw_version_translation_log` and others) —
each added by its own, separate change. Reconciling this requirement's
enumerated list against every such change is out of scope for
`lti-tool-provider-role`; this requirement is phrased as a lower bound ("at
least") for that reason, and each schema-adding change remains responsible
for reconciling its own additions into this list at archive time, per the
precedent this requirement's own text already established for
`ris_sync_record`/`peppol_transmission`.

`lti_platform` and `lti_tool` are mutable registration schemas (an external
Platform or Tool this instance has a trust relationship with — see the
`lti-platform` capability's REQ-LTI-001/002 for their field shape, including
the per-registration `signingKeys[]` array, and REQ-LTI-011 for the `status`
trust-gate field added by this change). `lti_deployment` is a mutable join
schema linking exactly one `lti_platform` or `lti_tool` to a consuming-app
placement (REQ-LTI-010), extended by this change with `resourceLinkMappings[]`
(REQ-LTI-013). `lti_identity_link` is a new mutable schema recording a
`(ltiPlatformId, subject)` → Nextcloud `userId` mapping (REQ-LTI-012). None of
the four is a log schema: none is append-only, and none carries the
`x-openregister-archival` annotation (REQ-A-004 continues to apply only to
the 4 existing log schemas).

Each schema MUST declare `slug`, `title`, `version`, and `properties` at
minimum. Each schema's `properties` MUST cover every protected field declared on
the matching `lib/Db/<EntityName>.php` entity (excluding internally-derived
fields like `id` which OR manages automatically).

#### Scenario: All 21 schemas present

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07: the descriptor declares 72 schemas, not 21. Left visible rather than annotated, because a waiver would record coverage for a claim that is no longer true.

- **GIVEN** the descriptor file is parsed
- **WHEN** inspecting `components.schemas`
- **THEN** at least 21 schema entries MUST exist, including all 21 named in
  this requirement
- **AND** their slugs MUST be the union of the 16 mutable config and 4 log
  slugs
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page

#### Scenario: Schema field coverage matches entity definition

- **GIVEN** the `Source` entity defined in `lib/Db/Source.php` with 39 protected fields
- **WHEN** comparing against the `source` schema's `properties`
- **THEN** every entity protected field MUST appear as a property on the schema
- **AND** the property `type` MUST map per the conversion: PHP `string` → JSON
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page
  `string`, PHP `integer` → JSON `integer`, PHP `boolean` → JSON `boolean`,
  PHP `array` (json column) → JSON `array` or `object`, PHP `DateTime` → JSON
  `string` with `format: "date-time"`

#### Scenario: lti_platform, lti_tool, and lti_deployment are mutable, not append-only

- **GIVEN** the descriptor file is parsed
- **WHEN** inspecting the `lti_platform`, `lti_tool`, and `lti_deployment`
  schema entries
- **THEN** none SHALL carry `immutable: true` or an
  `x-openregister-archival` annotation
- **AND** all three SHALL remain in the mutable config group counted by this
  requirement
- @e2e exclude a register-descriptor shape assertion, read from JSON rather than from a rendered page
