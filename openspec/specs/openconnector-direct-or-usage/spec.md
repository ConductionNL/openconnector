# openconnector-direct-or-usage Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change openconnector-services-direct-or-usage. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: All 15 mapper files MUST be deleted

All fifteen `lib/Db/*Mapper.php` files MUST be deleted from the integriq
repository. After this change ships, no file under `lib/` or `tests/` SHALL
reference any of these mapper class names in a `use` statement or a `new`
expression.

The 15 files are:
`lib/Db/CallLogMapper.php`, `lib/Db/ConsumerMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/EndpointMapper.php`, `lib/Db/EventMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/EventMessageMapper.php`, `lib/Db/EventSubscriptionMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/JobMapper.php`, `lib/Db/JobLogMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/MappingMapper.php`, `lib/Db/RuleMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/SourceMapper.php`, `lib/Db/SynchronizationMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/SynchronizationContractMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/SynchronizationContractLogMapper.php`,
`lib/Db/SynchronizationLogMapper.php`.

#### Scenario: Mapper files are absent post-merge
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it. Verified 2026-09-07: `lib/Db` is gone and the only two `*Mapper.php` left are StUFFieldMapper and FormFieldMapper, which are field mappers, not entity QBMappers

GIVEN the chain C merge commit has been applied
WHEN a developer runs `find lib/ -name '*Mapper.php' | grep -v 'StUFFieldMapper'`
THEN the command produces zero output (all legacy mapper files are gone)

#### Scenario: Quality gate rejects mapper re-introduction
- @e2e exclude the behaviour of a quality gate, exercised by feeding it deliberately bad input, which an e2e against a running app cannot do

GIVEN the quality gate (PHPCS sniff or grep-based composer script) is active
WHEN a developer accidentally adds `use OCA\Integriq\Db\SourceMapper;` to any file under `lib/` or `tests/`
THEN `composer check:strict` fails with a human-readable error identifying the forbidden import

---

### Requirement: All 15 entity files MUST be deleted

All fifteen `lib/Db/<Entity>.php` domain-data entity classes MUST be deleted
from the integriq repository, per ADR-001 ("ALL domain data → OpenRegister
objects. NO custom Entity/Mapper for domain data."). After this change ships,
no file under `lib/` or `tests/` SHALL reference any of these entity class names
in a `use` statement, type hint, or `new` expression.

The 15 files are:
`lib/Db/CallLog.php`, `lib/Db/Consumer.php`, `lib/Db/Endpoint.php`,
`lib/Db/Event.php`, `lib/Db/EventMessage.php`,
`lib/Db/EventSubscription.php`, `lib/Db/Job.php`, `lib/Db/JobLog.php`,
`lib/Db/Mapping.php`, `lib/Db/Rule.php`, `lib/Db/Source.php`,
`lib/Db/Synchronization.php`, `lib/Db/SynchronizationContract.php`,
`lib/Db/SynchronizationContractLog.php`, `lib/Db/SynchronizationLog.php`.

#### Scenario: Entity files are absent post-merge
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it. Verified 2026-09-07: `lib/Db` does not exist

GIVEN the chain C merge commit has been applied
WHEN a developer runs `find lib/Db/ -maxdepth 1 -name '*.php' -not -path '*/Dto/*'`
THEN the command produces zero output (only the `Dto/` subdirectory remains under `lib/Db/`)

#### Scenario: No entity type hints survive in services
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C rewrite is complete
WHEN `grep -rn "OCA\\\\Integriq\\\\Db\\\\Source\b" lib/ tests/` is run
THEN the command produces zero matches (no surviving references to deleted entity types)

---

### Requirement: integriq data migration MUST run at upgrade time

The Nextcloud migration class `lib/Migration/Version2Date20260908000000.php` MUST run on `occ upgrade` and MUST: (a) call `\OCA\OpenRegister\Service\ConfigurationService::importFromApp()` to materialise the openconnector register from `lib/Settings/integriq_register.json`, then (b) call `\OCA\Integriq\Service\Migration\LegacyToRegisterMigrator::migrateAll()` to copy every row from each of the 15 `oc_openconnector_*` legacy tables into `oc_openregister_objects`.

The migrator MUST be idempotent (the migration class skips when the `openconnector.storage_migrated` IAppConfig flag is `'true'`), MUST preserve uuids byte-for-byte, MUST translate the 6 integer FK columns to OR uuids via a post-INSERT UPDATE pass, MUST branch `Synchronization.sourceId/targetId` across the 3 documented value formats (integer-PK, register/schema slug, uuid), MUST set the `owner` column to null on every migrated row (system-owned), and MUST emit a single summary entry in `oc_openregister_audit_trail` (NOT per-row).

The migrator MUST assert the codebase is in the plaintext-credentials state documented by ADR-007 at startup (no `OCA\Integriq\Service\EncryptionService` class present) and MUST abort with a `\LogicException` if that assertion fails.

On a clean full run, the migrator MUST set `openconnector.storage_migrated` to `'true'`. Until that flag flips, the connector-specific services that use `ObjectService` MUST refuse to start (startup assertion in `Application.php`).

#### Scenario: Migration runs on upgrade
- @e2e exclude an `occ upgrade` behaviour. A migration and its repair step run there and nowhere else, so a browser session never reaches this path

GIVEN integriq is upgraded from a pre-chain-C version (legacy tables present, `storage_migrated` unset)
WHEN `occ upgrade` runs
THEN `Version2Date20260908000000::postSchemaChange()` MUST call `ConfigurationService::importFromApp()` followed by `LegacyToRegisterMigrator::migrateAll()`
AND on success MUST set `openconnector.storage_migrated = 'true'`

#### Scenario: Migration is idempotent
- @e2e exclude an `occ upgrade` behaviour. A migration and its repair step run there and nowhere else, so a browser session never reaches this path

GIVEN `openconnector.storage_migrated = 'true'` is already set
WHEN `occ upgrade` re-runs
THEN the migration class MUST detect the flag and skip without re-running the migrator (no duplicate rows)

#### Scenario: OCC retry command exists
- @e2e exclude a console command's existence. Verified 2026-09-07: `lib/Command/MigrateToOpenRegister.php`. `occ` has no browser session, so an e2e cannot reach it

GIVEN the migration partially failed and `storage_migrated` is NOT `'true'`
WHEN an admin runs `occ integriq:migrate-storage --entity source` (single-entity retry)
THEN the migrator MUST process only the `source` entity AND MUST NOT flip the `storage_migrated` flag (single-entity runs require a subsequent full-run to mark clean)

---

### Requirement: Every service MUST be rewritten to inject ObjectService directly

Every `lib/Service/` file that previously injected a mapper MUST be rewritten to inject `\OCA\OpenRegister\Service\ObjectService` directly.
All PHP files under `lib/Service/` that previously injected one or more
`<Resource>Mapper` classes MUST be rewritten to inject
`\OCA\OpenRegister\Service\ObjectService` via constructor injection instead.
Services MUST call OR's `ObjectService` using **named-parameter** invocations (NOT positional) to avoid the context-leak footgun documented at `openregister/lib/Service/ObjectService.php:587-589`. The canonical call shapes are:
- `$objectService->find(id: $uuid, register: 'integriq', schema: '<schema>')`
- `$objectService->findAll(config: ['filters' => ['register' => 'integriq', 'schema' => '<schema>', ...]])`
- `$objectService->saveObject(object: $data, register: 'integriq', schema: '<schema>', uuid: $uuid)` — `$uuid` is null for create, set for update
- `$objectService->deleteObject(uuid: $uuid)` — method is `deleteObject`, NOT `delete`; register/schema not needed since the uuid alone uniquely identifies the object
No service SHALL retain a constructor dependency on any of the 31 deleted types after this change ships.

#### Scenario: Source service reads a Source object via ObjectService

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07 against the tree: no such class exists under `lib/`. The cutover landed differently from this change's design, and the scenario below describes an artefact that was never built. Left in place rather than deleted so the divergence stays visible; it needs rewriting against what shipped, not annotating.

GIVEN `SourceService` has been rewritten
WHEN `SourceService::getSource($uuid)` is called
THEN the service calls `$this->objectService->find(id: $uuid, register: 'integriq', schema: 'source')` exactly once and returns the resulting `ObjectEntity`

#### Scenario: Job service saves a new job via ObjectService
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg (`tests/Unit/Service/JobServiceTest.php`)

GIVEN `JobService` has been rewritten
WHEN `JobService::createJob(array $data)` is called with valid job data
THEN the service passes the data to `$this->objectService->saveObject(object: $data, register: 'integriq', schema: 'job')` and returns the resulting `ObjectEntity`

#### Scenario: Source service deletes a Source via ObjectService

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07 against the tree: no such class exists under `lib/`. The cutover landed differently from this change's design, and the scenario below describes an artefact that was never built. Left in place rather than deleted so the divergence stays visible; it needs rewriting against what shipped, not annotating.

GIVEN `SourceService` has been rewritten
WHEN `SourceService::deleteSource($uuid)` is called
THEN the service calls `$this->objectService->deleteObject(uuid: $uuid)` exactly once and propagates a true return value

#### Scenario: No mapper constructor dependency survives in any service
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C rewrite is complete
WHEN `grep -rn "Mapper \$" lib/Service/` is run
THEN the command produces zero matches (no mapper-typed constructor parameters remain)

---

### Requirement: Every controller MUST receive data via rewritten services, not via mappers

Every `lib/Controller/` file that previously injected a mapper MUST be rewritten to use only service-layer or `ObjectService` dependencies.
All PHP files under `lib/Controller/` that previously injected a
`<Resource>Mapper` class MUST be rewritten so that their constructors ONLY accept
service-layer or `ObjectService` dependencies — never a mapper. Controllers that
previously called `$this->sourceMapper->find($id)` MUST instead call the
corresponding service method or call `$this->objectService->find(id: $uuid, register: 'integriq', schema: 'source')` directly.
The HTTP wire format (response JSON shape) SHALL remain byte-for-byte identical
to the chain B baseline, produced via `ObjectEntity::jsonSerialize()`.

#### Scenario: SourcesController returns the correct wire format
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg (`tests/Unit/Controller/SourcesControllerTest.php`)

GIVEN the Sources controller has been rewritten
WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/sources`
THEN the response JSON contains a `results` array where each element has `id`, `uuid`, `name`, `type`, `created`, `updated` fields matching the chain A schema property names

#### Scenario: Controller rejects invalid POST payload with 400
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg (`tests/Unit/Controller/SourcesControllerTest.php`)

GIVEN the Sources controller uses `SourceDto::fromArray()` for write validation
WHEN a POST request to `/api/sources` is made without a required `name` field
THEN the controller returns HTTP 400 with an error message identifying the missing field

#### Scenario: No mapper dependency in any controller constructor
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C rewrite is complete
WHEN `grep -rn "Mapper \$" lib/Controller/` is run
THEN the command produces zero matches

---

### Requirement: Application.php DI bindings MUST be updated

`lib/AppInfo/Application.php` MUST remove every
`$context->registerService(<Resource>Mapper::class, …)` call for the 15 deleted
mapper types. After this change, the `Application` class SHALL NOT register any
of the 31 deleted types as services. `ObjectService` (provided by the
openregister app) SHALL be wired as a constructor-injection dependency wherever
needed, following the standard Nextcloud DI container resolution pattern (no
manual alias required if openregister already registers it).

#### Scenario: Application boots without mapper service registrations
- @e2e exclude a container-wiring behaviour at app boot. Every e2e in this suite boots the app, so a regression here fails all of them rather than one, but nothing asserts the ABSENCE of a registration from the browser

GIVEN the chain C merge is applied and `openconnector.storage_migrated` is `'true'`
WHEN Nextcloud boots the integriq app
THEN `Application::register()` completes without errors and no mapper alias is registered in the DI container

#### Scenario: Application fails fast when storage_migrated is not set
- @e2e exclude requires booting the app with the flag UNSET, which is a state the e2e instance is never in: `ci-seed.sh` provisions the register before Playwright starts

GIVEN a fresh environment where chain B has not been run (`storage_migrated !== 'true'`)
WHEN Nextcloud boots the integriq app
THEN `Application::register()` throws `\LogicException` with a message containing the operator runbook command `occ integriq:migrate-storage`

#### Scenario: Pre-flight check is bypassable in CI via env var
- @e2e exclude an environment-variable behaviour of the boot check, exercised by CI configuration rather than by a browser

GIVEN the env var `INTEGRIQ_SKIP_STORAGE_MIGRATED_ASSERT=1` is set (or the
still-honoured legacy spelling `OPENCONNECTOR_SKIP_STORAGE_MIGRATED_ASSERT=1`)
WHEN Nextcloud boots the integriq app in a CI/test environment
THEN `Application::register()` does NOT throw `\LogicException` even if `storage_migrated` is absent or `'false'`

---

### Requirement: composer check:strict MUST pass with all deleted files removed

`composer check:strict` MUST produce zero errors after deletion of all 31 files (PHPCS, PHPMD, Psalm, PHPStan).
Autoload
configuration in `composer.json` SHALL be updated to remove any classmap or
PSR-4 entries that reference the deleted files or the deleted `lib/Db/` top-level
classes. Any `psalm.xml` or `phpstan.neon` exclusion entries that existed solely
to suppress errors on the now-deleted types MUST be removed.

#### Scenario: Quality gates pass after file deletions
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN all 31 files have been deleted and callers have been rewritten
WHEN `composer check:strict` is run in the integriq repository root
THEN the command exits with code 0 (PHPCS, PHPMD, Psalm, PHPStan all pass)

#### Scenario: Autoload does not reference deleted classes
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C merge is applied
WHEN `composer dump-autoload --dry-run` is run
THEN no class-map entry references `OCA\Integriq\Db\Source` or any other deleted entity/mapper type

---

### Requirement: No file under lib/ or tests/ may reference deleted types post-merge

A quality gate MUST be added to `composer check:strict` (implemented as a PHPCS
custom sniff or a `composer.json` scripts entry running a grep-based check) that
fails the build with exit code 1 if any of the 31 deleted PHP types
appears in a `use` statement or direct class reference anywhere under `lib/` or
`tests/`. The 31 types are:

- 15 entity classes under `lib/Db/`: `OCA\Integriq\Db\<Resource>` for each of the 15 resources (`Source`, `Endpoint`, `Consumer`, `Event`, `EventMessage`, `EventSubscription`, `Job`, `JobLog`, `Mapping`, `Rule`, `Synchronization`, `SynchronizationContract`, `SynchronizationContractLog`, `SynchronizationLog`, `CallLog`)
- 15 mapper classes under `lib/Db/`: `OCA\Integriq\Db\<Resource>Mapper` for each of the 15 resources
- 1 facade class under `lib/Service/Storage/`: `OCA\Integriq\Service\Storage\ObjectMapperFacade`

This gate SHALL be active in CI and SHALL run on every push to the chain C branch.

#### Scenario: Quality gate blocks forbidden entity import
- @e2e exclude the behaviour of a quality gate, exercised by feeding it deliberately bad input, which an e2e against a running app cannot do

GIVEN the quality gate is installed and running
WHEN a file under `lib/` contains `use OCA\Integriq\Db\Job;`
THEN the quality gate exits non-zero and reports the forbidden import with file and line number

#### Scenario: Quality gate blocks ObjectMapperFacade re-introduction
- @e2e exclude the behaviour of a quality gate, exercised by feeding it deliberately bad input, which an e2e against a running app cannot do. Verified 2026-09-07: no file under lib/ names ObjectMapperFacade

GIVEN the quality gate is installed and running
WHEN any file under `lib/` or `tests/` contains `use OCA\Integriq\Service\Storage\ObjectMapperFacade;`
THEN the quality gate exits non-zero with a message: "ObjectMapperFacade was deliberately deleted in chain C — services MUST inject ObjectService directly"

#### Scenario: Quality gate does not flag DTO or unrelated classes
- @e2e exclude the behaviour of a quality gate, exercised by feeding it deliberately bad input, which an e2e against a running app cannot do

GIVEN the quality gate is installed
WHEN a file under `lib/Db/Dto/` contains `use OCA\Integriq\Db\Dto\SourceDto;`
THEN the quality gate exits zero (DTO imports are permitted)

---

### Requirement: Existing unit tests MUST be rewritten to mock ObjectService

Every `tests/Unit/` file that imported a deleted type MUST be rewritten to mock `\OCA\OpenRegister\Service\ObjectService` instead.
All PHP test files under `tests/Unit/` that previously imported, instantiated,
or mocked one of the 31 deleted types MUST be rewritten to mock
`\OCA\OpenRegister\Service\ObjectService` and assert against
`\OCA\OpenRegister\Db\ObjectEntity` return values instead. The rewritten tests
SHALL maintain at least the same assertion coverage as the pre-rewrite tests.
No test file SHALL contain a `use` statement for any of the 30 deleted entity/mapper
types after this change ships.

#### Scenario: SourceService unit test passes with ObjectService mock

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07 against the tree: no such class exists under `lib/`. The cutover landed differently from this change's design, and the scenario below describes an artefact that was never built. Left in place rather than deleted so the divergence stays visible; it needs rewriting against what shipped, not annotating.

GIVEN the SourceService unit test has been rewritten
WHEN the test calls `SourceService::getSource($uuid)` with a mocked `ObjectService` that returns a stub `ObjectEntity`
THEN the test passes and the assertion verifies that `objectService->find` was called with `('openconnector', 'source', $uuid)`

#### Scenario: All unit tests pass after rewrite
- @e2e exclude a statement about the PHPUnit suite itself, not about the product

GIVEN all unit tests under `tests/Unit/` have been rewritten
WHEN `composer phpunit` is run targeting the `tests/Unit/` directory
THEN the test suite passes with no errors and coverage is ≥ 80% line / ≥ 70% branch on rewritten services

---

### Requirement: Newman/Postman integration tests MUST still pass

The Newman integration test collection MUST continue to pass without modification — the HTTP surface SHALL be byte-identical before and after chain C.
The Newman (Postman) integration test collection that covers the integriq
REST API MUST continue to pass without modification after this change ships.
The HTTP surface (endpoint paths, request shapes, response shapes, status codes)
SHALL be identical before and after chain C. Any test that asserts the JSON
response body shape SHALL pass because `ObjectEntity::jsonSerialize()` over the
chain A schema produces the same field names and value types as the deleted typed
entities did.

#### Scenario: Sources list endpoint returns unchanged JSON shape
- @e2e exclude no test asserts the WIRE SHAPE. `configuration-export-import.spec.ts` reaches OpenRegister's objects surface for `source`, which touches the subject without establishing that the JSON shape is unchanged

GIVEN chain C is deployed
WHEN the Newman collection runs the `GET /api/sources` test case
THEN the test passes with an HTTP 200 response whose body matches the stored contract fixture (same field names, same value types)

#### Scenario: Synchronization run endpoint is still reachable

GIVEN chain C is deployed
WHEN the Newman collection runs the `POST /api/synchronizations/{id}/run` test case
THEN the test passes with the expected status code and response body (no regression in the action endpoint layer)

---

### Requirement: Synchronization.sourceId branching logic MUST survive intact

`SynchronizationService` MUST preserve the three-format `sourceId` branching logic (integer-PK, register/schema slug-pair, UUID) verbatim (per ADR-005).
The three-format branching logic for `Synchronization.sourceId` (integer-PK
format, `register/schema` slug-pair format, and UUID format) MUST be preserved
verbatim in the rewritten `SynchronizationService`. Per ADR-005 (Source /
Synchronization / SynchronizationContract triad) and chain B's REQ-004, a
`SynchronizationService` MUST contain a `resolveSyncRef` helper method (or
delegate to a dedicated `lib/Service/Helper/SyncRefResolver` service) that
implements all three format branches and preserves the skip-on-unrecognised
semantics. The helper MUST be unit-tested with at least four scenarios covering
each format variant plus the unrecognised-format fallback.

#### Scenario: Integer-PK sourceId is resolved to a UUID via ObjectService
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN a `Synchronization` record whose `sourceId` is the string `"42"` (legacy integer PK format)
WHEN `SyncRefResolver::resolve("42")` is called
THEN the resolver identifies the variant as `'integer-pk'`, looks up the integer-PK→uuid mapping via the per-resource cache or a one-shot `findAll(config: ['filters' => ['register' => 'integriq', 'schema' => 'source', 'legacyId' => 42]])` query, then calls `$objectService->find(id: $resolvedUuid, register: 'integriq', schema: 'source')` to obtain the canonical `ObjectEntity`

#### Scenario: Register-schema slug-pair sourceId is resolved
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN a `Synchronization` record whose `sourceId` is `"integriq/source"` (slug-pair format)
WHEN `SyncRefResolver::resolve("integriq/source")` is called
THEN the resolver identifies the variant as `'register-schema'` and returns the resolved pair without a direct ObjectService lookup

#### Scenario: UUID sourceId passes through unchanged
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN a `Synchronization` record whose `sourceId` is `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"` (UUID format)
WHEN `SyncRefResolver::resolve("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")` is called
THEN the resolver identifies the variant as `'uuid'` and returns the value unchanged

#### Scenario: Unrecognised format is skipped without error
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN a `Synchronization` record whose `sourceId` is an empty string or a value matching none of the three formats
WHEN `SyncRefResolver::resolve("")` is called
THEN the resolver returns a result with variant `'unrecognised'` and `SynchronizationService` logs a warning and skips the record without throwing an exception

---

### Requirement: Source credential fields MUST be handled with explicit EncryptionService calls

Every call site reading `apikey`, `password`, `secret`, `jwt`, `jwtId`, or `username` from a Source `ObjectEntity` MUST call `EncryptionService::decrypt(...)` explicitly (per ADR-007).
The six credential-bearing fields on `Source` (`secret`, `password`,
`apikey`, `jwt`, `jwtId`, `username`) are currently stored as plaintext in the
openregister object JSON body. Because chain C removes the implicit getter/setter
encryption hooks that existed in the deleted `Source` entity class, every call
site in `lib/Service/` or `lib/Controller/` that reads one of these fields from
an `ObjectEntity` MUST explicitly call `EncryptionService::decrypt(…)` before
using the value in an outbound HTTP request or logging context. This requirement
acknowledges the current plaintext state (ADR-007) and ensures that when
`EncryptionService` is fully wired in a future change, the explicit call sites
are already in place.

#### Scenario: CallService reads apikey via explicit decrypt call
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg (`tests/Unit/Service/CallServiceTest.php`)

GIVEN `CallService` has been rewritten
WHEN `CallService` reads the `apikey` field from a Source `ObjectEntity`
THEN the code path calls `$this->encryptionService->decrypt($obj->getObject()['apikey'])` before passing the value to Guzzle auth configuration (not reading the raw field value directly)

#### Scenario: No raw field access for credential fields in any service
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C rewrite is complete
WHEN `grep -rn "getObject()\['apikey'\]" lib/Service/` is run (without a surrounding decrypt call)
THEN every match is preceded by `$this->encryptionService->decrypt(` on the same line or the immediately preceding line

---

### Requirement: Endpoint targetType/targetId dispatch logic MUST be preserved

`EndpointService` MUST preserve the polymorphic `targetType` / `targetId` dispatch branches for all four known target types intact (per ADR-008).
The polymorphic `targetType` / `targetId` dispatch mechanism in
`EndpointService::handleEndpointRequest()` MUST be preserved intact after the
entity/mapper deletion. The four known `targetType` values (`register/schema`,
`api`, `job`, `synchronization`) and their respective `targetId` parsing rules
MUST continue to work as documented in ADR-008. The rewritten service MUST read
`targetType` and `targetId` from the `ObjectEntity::getObject()` array rather
than from typed entity getters, and the dispatch branching SHALL remain otherwise
unchanged.

#### Scenario: register/schema targetType dispatches to ObjectService CRUD
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN an Endpoint record with `targetType = 'register/schema'` and `targetId = '20/111'`
WHEN a request is made to that endpoint
THEN `EndpointService` splits `targetId` on `/`, validates both parts as numeric, and dispatches to `ObjectService::getMapper(schema, register)` (unchanged from chain B)

#### Scenario: api targetType dispatches to CallService proxy
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN an Endpoint record with `targetType = 'api'` and `targetId = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'` (Source UUID)
WHEN a request is made to that endpoint
THEN `EndpointService` reads the Source object via `$objectService->find(id: $targetId, register: 'integriq', schema: 'source')` and proxies the request through `CallService`

#### Scenario: Unknown targetType returns a meaningful error
- @e2e exclude a PHPUnit service behaviour, not a DOM one; the suite runs 2770 tests on every CI leg

GIVEN an Endpoint record with `targetType = 'unknown-type'`
WHEN a request is made to that endpoint
THEN `EndpointService` throws an exception with a message indicating the unrecognised target type (preserving the existing fallback guard)

---

### Requirement: Multi-platform DB compatibility MUST be preserved

All new query code introduced in this change MUST use `IQueryBuilder` / `QBMapper` exclusively (per ADR-009) — no new MySQL-specific raw SQL SHALL be added.
Because chain C removes all `lib/Db/*Mapper.php` files (which were the
primary raw-SQL location), the post-merge `lib/` tree MUST contain no new
MySQL-specific constructs. The known pre-existing MySQL-only SQL in
`SettingsService::applyRetention()` (`DATE_ADD`, `SHOW COLUMNS`, backtick
quoting) is explicitly out of scope for this change — it MUST NOT be fixed here,
but MUST be tracked as a follow-up issue (cross-reference ADR-009).

#### Scenario: No new MySQL-specific SQL is introduced
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C rewrite is complete
WHEN `grep -rn "DATE_ADD\|SHOW COLUMNS\|INTERVAL.*MICROSECOND" lib/` is run
THEN every match found is a pre-existing occurrence in `SettingsService.php` (not any newly written code)

#### Scenario: New calls to ObjectService use platform-neutral interface
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C rewrite is complete
WHEN `grep -rn "executeQuery\|createFunction\|backtick" lib/Service/` is run (excluding pre-existing known violations)
THEN the command produces zero NEW occurrences outside of the known pre-existing `SettingsService` violations

---

### Requirement: Per-schema CRUD controllers MUST be deleted; only connector-specific action endpoints remain

Controllers under `lib/Controller/` that exposed only standard CRUD operations over a single integriq domain entity MUST be deleted. OR's `/api/objects/{register}/{schema}/*` route family already exposes generic CRUD; per-schema duplication in integriq is redundant. Connector-specific action endpoints (`/api/jobs/{id}/run`, `/api/sources/{id}/test`, `/api/synchronizations/{id}/trigger`, `/api/import`, `/api/export`, `/api/endpoint/{...}` inbound dispatch, etc.) MUST be preserved.

Schema-driven input validation (rejecting missing required fields, type-coercing inputs, etc.) is handled by OR's built-in schema validator when `ObjectService::saveObject()` is called against a register+schema with declared `required` and typed `properties`. The chain A descriptor at `lib/Settings/integriq_register.json` defines those constraints. **No integriq-side DTO layer is needed at CRUD boundaries.** Dedicated DTO classes MAY be introduced ONLY at the input boundary of connector-specific actions (e.g. a `SyncTriggerDto` for the body of `POST /api/synchronizations/{id}/trigger`) when the action's input shape doesn't match any single schema.

#### Scenario: per-schema CRUD controller is deleted
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it. gate-17 redundant-controller also holds this shape

GIVEN the chain C cutover is applied
WHEN `find lib/Controller/ -name '<Resource>sController.php'` is run for each of the 15 schema-CRUD controllers identified during apply
THEN each named file MUST NOT exist
AND the corresponding routes in `appinfo/routes.php` MUST be removed

#### Scenario: connector-specific action controller is preserved
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it

GIVEN the chain C cutover is applied
WHEN inspecting `lib/Controller/CallController.php`, `lib/Controller/ExportController.php`, `lib/Controller/ImportController.php`, `lib/Controller/EndpointController.php` (inbound dispatch — NOT the deleted `EndpointsController` CRUD), and the new `lib/Controller/MigrateStorageController.php`
THEN each MUST still exist
AND their action routes MUST still be present in `appinfo/routes.php`

#### Scenario: OR CRUD route handles a Source create without an integriq controller
- @e2e exclude no test asserts that a Source CREATE lands on OpenRegister's route rather than an integriq one. The UI CRUD spec creates Sources, but through the app, so it cannot tell the two apart

GIVEN integriq is post-chain-C
WHEN a client issues `POST /index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects/integriq/source` with `{"name":"test","type":"api"}`
THEN OR's generic CRUD route MUST persist the object via `ObjectService::saveObject(object: ..., register: 'integriq', schema: 'source')` and return the created `ObjectEntity` JSON
AND no integriq-side controller MUST be involved in serving this request

### Requirement: Import/Export controllers + DashboardController MUST be deleted; OR's HTTP surface + declarative dashboard widgets cover their cases

`lib/Controller/ImportController.php`, `lib/Service/ImportService.php`, `lib/Controller/ExportController.php`, `lib/Service/ExportService.php`, and `lib/Controller/DashboardController.php` MUST all be deleted. The corresponding `appinfo/routes.php` entries MUST be removed. The total deletion is approximately 837 LOC.

- **Import/Export deletions are justified by OR coverage:** OR exposes `POST /api/registers/{id}/import`, `POST /api/configurations/{id}/import`, `POST /api/objects/{register}/{schema}/` (single-object create), `GET /api/registers/{id}/export`, `GET /api/objects/{register}/{schema}/export`, and `GET /api/objects/{register}/{schema}/{id}` (single-object read) routes that cover every use case integriq's `ImportController`/`ExportController` served. Slug-translation logic (per local ADR-015) is preserved by a thin `SlugTranslatorService` decorator (see separate requirement below).
- **DashboardController deletion is justified by manifest declarative widgets:** the post-D2 `src/manifest.json` `Dashboard` page uses `type: dashboard` and declares its widgets via `dataSource: { register, schema, filter, aggregate: 'count' }` blocks resolved by `CnStatsBlockWidget` from `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` against OR's generic aggregate endpoint. Decidesk's manifest (`/decidesk/src/manifest.json` Dashboard entry) demonstrates the working pattern with stats-block widgets for review/published/open-items counts — analogous widgets cover integriq's CallStats, JobStats, SyncStats.

#### Scenario: ImportController + ExportController files are absent post-merge
- @e2e exclude a static assertion over the tree (file presence, constructor shapes, imports). Nothing a browser can observe; `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and the hydra gates are what hold it. Verified 2026-09-07: neither file exists

GIVEN the chain C cutover is applied
WHEN `find lib/Controller/ -name 'ImportController.php' -o -name 'ExportController.php' -o -name 'DashboardController.php'` is run
THEN the command produces zero output

#### Scenario: OR export endpoint serves a Source export without an integriq controller
- @e2e exclude no test drives the EXPORT endpoint. `configuration-export-import.spec.ts` reaches OpenRegister's configuration listing and objects surfaces, which is a different endpoint

GIVEN integriq is post-chain-C with at least one Source object stored in OR
WHEN a client issues `GET /index.php/apps/openregister/api/objects/integriq/source/{uuid}` with `Accept: application/json`
THEN OR's generic objects endpoint MUST return the Source object JSON (no integriq controller involved in the request path)
AND if the request includes `X-Slug-Translation: true`, the response JSON MUST have integer FK fields replaced with their portable slug form by the `SlugTranslatorService` decorator (per local ADR-015)

#### Scenario: Dashboard page uses declarative manifest widgets, not the deleted controller
- @e2e exclude the manifest type and the page mount are proven by `manifest-pages.spec.ts`, and that file's own header already records this scenario as deliberately NOT anchored: that widget counts resolve via dataSource blocks against OpenRegister's aggregate endpoint is not asserted anywhere

GIVEN integriq is post-chain-C
WHEN the user navigates to the Dashboard page
THEN the page MUST render via `CnDashboardPage` driven by `src/manifest.json` Dashboard entry with `type: "dashboard"`
AND the page's widgets MUST resolve their counts via `dataSource` blocks pointing at OR's generic aggregate endpoint — NOT via an integriq-side DashboardController

---

### Requirement: SettingsController MUST shrink to connector-specific actions only

`lib/Controller/SettingsController.php` MUST be reduced from ~200 LOC to ~80 LOC. The methods `stats()`, `getSettings()`, `updateSettings()`, and `rebase()` MUST be deleted — they reimplement OR's `/api/settings/*` surface or are superseded by other chain-C deliverables. The ONLY method preserved on the controller is the integriq-specific `applyRetention()` action (itself flagged for follow-up replacement per [#822](https://github.com/ConductionNL/integriq/issues/822) Postgres portability).

#### Scenario: SettingsController only exposes the applyRetention action

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07: `SettingsController` exposes `rebase`, not `applyRetention`. The controller survived the cutover with a different surface than this change anticipated.

GIVEN the chain C cutover is applied
WHEN `grep -E 'public function (page|stats|getSettings|updateSettings|rebase|applyRetention)' lib/Controller/SettingsController.php` is run
THEN only `page()` (Nextcloud SPA shell) and `applyRetention()` MUST appear in the output

---

### Requirement: integriq ConfigurationService MUST be reduced to a slug-translation decorator and renamed

`lib/Service/ConfigurationService.php` (835 LOC) MUST be renamed to `lib/Service/SlugTranslatorService.php` (~150 LOC). The renamed service MUST expose exactly two public methods: `translateOnExport(array $object): array` and `translateOnImport(array $object): array`. The deleted methods (`getEntitiesByConfiguration`, `exportConfiguration`, `exportRegister`, `importConfiguration`) MUST be removed — their use cases are covered by OR's `\OCA\OpenRegister\Service\ConfigurationService` (a different class in a different namespace) consumed via the routes referenced above.

The rename also resolves the namespace ambiguity introduced by having two `ConfigurationService` classes in the dependency graph.

#### Scenario: SlugTranslatorService replaces ConfigurationService

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07 against the tree: no such class exists under `lib/`. The cutover landed differently from this change's design, and the scenario below describes an artefact that was never built. Left in place rather than deleted so the divergence stays visible; it needs rewriting against what shipped, not annotating.

GIVEN the chain C cutover is applied
WHEN `find lib/Service/ -name 'ConfigurationService.php'` is run
THEN the command produces zero output (the file MUST have been renamed/replaced by `SlugTranslatorService.php`)

#### Scenario: SlugTranslatorService roundtrip preserves portability

> ⚠️ **Stale as written.** Verified 2026-09-07 against the tree: no such class exists under `lib/`. The cutover landed differently from this change's design, and the scenario below describes an artefact that was never built. Left in place rather than deleted so the divergence stays visible; it needs rewriting against what shipped, not annotating.

GIVEN an OR Source object with `synchronizationId: 'a1b2c3d4-...-...'` (uuid form)
WHEN `SlugTranslatorService::translateOnExport($object)` is called
THEN the returned array MUST have `synchronizationId` replaced with the target Synchronization's slug (or omitted if no slug exists)
AND `SlugTranslatorService::translateOnImport($result)` MUST translate the slug back to the local-environment uuid
