# flow-orchestration Specification

## Purpose

Provides a lightweight, declarative multi-step pipeline entity (`flow`) for
Integriq: an ordered list of steps, each referencing an existing
Source/Mapping/Synchronization/Endpoint/Approval by id, with an optional
JsonLogic run-if condition, a single-target `branch` step for non-linear
control flow, and a per-step `onError` policy. `FlowRunnerService`
executes flows by calling the existing `CallService`/`MappingService`/
`SynchronizationService`/`EventService`/`ApprovalService` public
entrypoints — it does not reimplement any of their logic (ADR-008
Controller → Service → Mapper layering; OpenRegister is the persistence
layer for every entity per ADR governing OR as the required runtime
dependency). This closes the "no multi-step workflow entity" competitive
gap (Specter insight #1249) without building a general-purpose workflow
engine — v1 ships a typed step-list editor (no parallel/fan-out, no loops).

**Scope note (2026-07-16, per ADR-065).** This Purpose previously ended
"or a drag-and-drop canvas — v1 ships a typed step-list editor only (no
canvas...)". The **canvas** exclusion is withdrawn — see REQ-009 — because
a shared canvas (`CnGraphCanvas` in `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`) is now the
fleet-standard authoring surface and a per-app opt-out defeats it. The
**engine** exclusion stands and in fact hardens: ADR-065 relocates flow
execution to OpenRegister, so Integriq must not grow a general-purpose
workflow engine here or anywhere (ADR-022). Parallel/fan-out and loops
remain out of scope *for this model* — the `order`-as-identity step list
cannot express them — and are delivered by the OpenRegister engine, whose
Petri-net core supports parallel splits and synchronising joins natively.

**Disambiguation:** this capability is unrelated to `flow-workflowengine-integration`
(a separate, sibling change that registers Integriq operations as
adapters inside Nextcloud core's own `files_workflowengine` UI). Both use
the word "flow"; neither touches the other's code.

**Scope note (2026-08-16, flow-engine-unification task 6.2).** The frontend
described by REQ-009 (the step-list editor UI, `FlowStepRow`, the
dirty/canSave contract) no longer exists in Integriq. `#/flows` now
renders the shared `CnFlowIndexPage`/`CnFlowDetail`/`CnFlowSidebar`
components from `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`, reading and writing
OpenRegister's own native flow store (`nodes[]`/`edges[]` via
`/apps/openregister/api/flows`) — a **different store** from the `flow`
schema REQ-001 describes below. `FlowRunnerService`, the `flows#run` route,
and the `register=openconnector, schema=flow` schema are **still live in
the backend** (REQ-001 through REQ-008 remain accurate for that backend
in isolation) but are no longer reachable through any UI, and no
automated migration exists between the two stores. This is tracked, not
silently accepted — see integriq#1255 for the current state, what
was hand-migrated, and what is still open. Treat REQ-001–008 as
describing a legacy, UI-unreachable backend; treat REQ-009–011 as
superseded and no longer testable against this app's own UI (the shared
canvas's own editor behaviour is covered by `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`'s
own test suite, not duplicated here).

## Requirements
### Requirement: Flow steps execute sequentially in `order` (REQ-001)

The system MUST provide a `flow` OpenRegister schema (register
`openconnector`, schema `flow`) with an ordered `steps[]` array, each step
carrying a stable integer `order` field (not array position).
`FlowRunnerService::run(ObjectEntity $flow, array $input = [], ?string
$triggerSource = null): ObjectEntity` MUST resolve `$flow->getObject()['steps']`,
sort by `order` ascending, and execute each step in that sequence by
dispatching to the step's `type` (`call` | `mapping` | `synchronization` |
`event` | `approval` | `branch`), resolving `configRef` to the referenced
Source/Mapping/Synchronization/Endpoint/Approval-group entity and calling
that entity's existing service method — `CallService::call()` for `call`,
`MappingService::executeMapping()` for `mapping`,
`SynchronizationService::synchronize()` for `synchronization`,
`EventService::emitCloudEvent()` for `event`. No step type's dispatch MUST
reimplement the logic of the service it calls.

@e2e exclude backend flow execution engine — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: a 3-step flow (call → mapping → synchronization) runs in order

- **GIVEN** a `flow` with three steps: order 10 `type: call` (Source X),
  order 20 `type: mapping` (Mapping Y), order 30 `type: synchronization`
  (Synchronization Z), each with `onError: stop`
- **WHEN** `FlowRunnerService::run($flow)` is called
- **THEN** `CallService::call()` is invoked first, its result becomes the
  input to `MappingService::executeMapping()`, and that mapped result
  becomes the input to `SynchronizationService::synchronize()`, invoked
  last
- **AND** the resulting `flow_run`'s `flow_run_log` contains exactly three
  entries in `stepOrder` order 10, 20, 30, each `status: completed`

#### Scenario: steps run in `order` value, not array position

- **GIVEN** a `flow` whose `steps[]` array lists the order-30 step before
  the order-10 step (out-of-position insertion)
- **WHEN** `FlowRunnerService::run($flow)` is called
- **THEN** execution still proceeds order 10 then order 30 (sorted by the
  `order` field, independent of array position)

### Requirement: Step context is threaded via the reused FlowToken (REQ-002)

`FlowRunnerService` MUST reuse `flow-token-helper`'s `FlowToken` as the
step-to-step data channel rather than introducing a second, competing
context object. Before each step runs, the system MUST set
`$flowToken->setSyncInputAmended()` to the previous step's output (or the
flow's initial `$input` for the first step); after a step produces a
result, the system MUST set `$flowToken->setSyncOutputAmended()` to that
result, which becomes the next step's `syncInputAmended`. For an
endpoint-triggered flow, `requestOriginal`/`responseOriginal` MUST be
seeded once at flow start from the triggering request so step conditions
MAY reference `request.parameters.*`, matching how an endpoint rule's
JsonLogic condition can already do so.

@e2e exclude backend flow context threading — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: a step's output becomes the next step's input

- **GIVEN** a 2-step flow where the order-10 `mapping` step returns
  `{ "id": "abc" }`
- **WHEN** the order-20 `synchronization` step runs
- **THEN** `SynchronizationService::synchronize()` is called with
  `data: { "id": "abc" }` (read from `$flowToken->getSyncInputAmended()`)

### Requirement: Step `condition` skips a step when it evaluates false (REQ-003)

The system MUST evaluate each step's optional JsonLogic `condition`
before dispatching that step, calling `JWadhams\JsonLogic::apply($step['condition'],
$context)` — the same static call already used by
`EndpointService::checkRuleConditions()` for endpoint rules — against the
current step context. If the condition evaluates to a value that does not
loosely equal `true`, the step MUST be skipped (not dispatched, no
downstream service called) and recorded in `flow_run_log` with
`status: skipped`. A step with no `condition` (absent or empty) MUST
always run.

@e2e exclude backend condition evaluation — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: a false condition skips the step

- **GIVEN** a flow's order-20 step has `condition: { "==": [{"var":
  "syncInputAmended.status"}, "active"] }` and the order-10 step's output
  is `{ "status": "inactive" }`
- **WHEN** the runner reaches the order-20 step
- **THEN** the step's service method is NOT called
- **AND** `flow_run_log` records a `stepOrder: 20, status: skipped` entry
- **AND** execution continues to the next step in sequence

#### Scenario: a true condition runs the step normally

- **GIVEN** the same flow but the order-10 step's output is
  `{ "status": "active" }`
- **WHEN** the runner reaches the order-20 step
- **THEN** the step's service method IS called and `flow_run_log` records
  `status: completed` (or `failed`, per REQ-005) for that step

### Requirement: `branch` step selects the next step via JsonLogic (REQ-004)

A step of `type: branch` MUST carry a `branches[]` array of
`{ condition, nextStepOrder }` pairs and MAY carry a
`defaultNextStepOrder`. The system MUST evaluate each `branches[].condition`
in array order via `JWadhams\JsonLogic::apply()` against the current step
context and, on the first match, set the next step to execute to that
entry's `nextStepOrder`, skipping any steps between the branch step and
the selected target. If no `branches[].condition` matches, the system
MUST use `defaultNextStepOrder` if present, or continue to the next step
in `order` sequence otherwise. A `branch` step's `nextStepOrder` or
`defaultNextStepOrder` that does not resolve to an existing step `order`
MUST cause the flow run to fail with a fatal error (not a silent skip),
regardless of any step's individual `onError` policy — an unresolvable
branch target is a configuration error, not a runtime step failure.

@e2e exclude backend branch step evaluation — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: branch selects the first matching target

- **GIVEN** a `branch` step at order 20 with
  `branches: [{ condition: {"==":[{"var":"syncInputAmended.mode"},"full"]}, nextStepOrder: 30 }, { condition: {"==":[{"var":"syncInputAmended.mode"},"incremental"]}, nextStepOrder: 40 }]`
  and the order-10 step's output is `{ "mode": "incremental" }`
- **WHEN** the runner reaches the order-20 branch step
- **THEN** execution jumps to the order-40 step
- **AND** the order-30 step is NOT executed and does NOT appear in
  `flow_run_log`

#### Scenario: no branch matches falls back to defaultNextStepOrder

- **GIVEN** the same branch step and the order-10 step's output is
  `{ "mode": "unknown" }`, with `defaultNextStepOrder: 30`
- **WHEN** the runner reaches the order-20 branch step
- **THEN** execution proceeds to the order-30 step

#### Scenario: an unresolvable branch target fails the run

- **GIVEN** a `branch` step whose only `branches[].nextStepOrder` is `99`
  and no step with `order: 99` exists in the flow
- **WHEN** that branch matches and is selected
- **THEN** the flow run fails with a fatal error
- **AND** `flow_run`'s status is recorded as `failed`, regardless of any
  step's configured `onError` policy

### Requirement: `approval` step suspends and resumes the flow run (REQ-005)

A step of `type: approval` MUST suspend the flow run by persisting an
`approval_request` OR object carrying `flowRunId` and `resumeStepOrder`
(the step immediately following the approval step), `approverGroup`,
`onReject`, `onTimeout`, following the same persistence shape
`ApprovalService::suspend()` already uses for endpoint-rule suspensions,
with `snapshot` set to the current `$flowToken->__serialize()`
(sensitive-header-stripped). `FlowRunnerService::run()` MUST return
immediately after suspending, with the `flow_run`'s status set to
`suspended`; no later step MUST execute in that invocation.

On approval, `FlowRunnerService::resumeFromApproval(ObjectEntity
$approvalRequest): ObjectEntity` MUST rehydrate the `FlowToken` via
`ApprovalService::rehydrateFlowToken()` (reused unmodified) and resume
execution at `resumeStepOrder`, continuing the same sequencing,
condition, branch, and `onError` rules as an unsuspended run. On
rejection, the flow run's status MUST be set to `stopped`. On timeout
(via `ApprovalService::sweepExpired()`'s existing cron sweep), the flow
run's status MUST be set per the approval step's `onTimeout` config,
matching the endpoint-rule case's `onTimeout` semantics.

@e2e exclude backend approval suspend/resume — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: an approval step suspends the run

- **GIVEN** a flow with an `approval` step at order 20
- **WHEN** the runner reaches the order-20 step
- **THEN** an `approval_request` OR object is created with
  `flowRunId` set to the current run and `resumeStepOrder: 30`
- **AND** `FlowRunnerService::run()` returns with `flow_run.status: suspended`
- **AND** no step after order 20 has executed

#### Scenario: approving the request resumes the flow from the next step

- **GIVEN** the suspended run from the previous scenario
- **WHEN** an authorized approver calls `POST /api/approvals/{id}/approve`
- **THEN** `FlowRunnerService::resumeFromApproval()` is invoked
- **AND** execution resumes at the order-30 step using the rehydrated
  `FlowToken`
- **AND** the flow run's status becomes `completed` once all remaining
  steps finish

#### Scenario: rejecting the request stops the flow

- **GIVEN** the suspended run
- **WHEN** an authorized approver calls `POST /api/approvals/{id}/reject`
  with a mandatory comment
- **THEN** no further flow steps execute
- **AND** the flow run's status becomes `stopped`

### Requirement: per-step `onError` policy governs failure handling (REQ-006)

Each step MUST carry an `onError` policy of `stop` (default), `continue`,
or `dead_letter`. If a step's dispatched service call throws, the system
MUST catch the throwable, record `flow_run_log` for that step with
`status: failed` and the captured error message, and then:

- `stop`: the flow run MUST end immediately with `flow_run.status: stopped`;
  no later step MUST execute.
- `continue`: the flow run MUST proceed to the next step in sequence as
  if the failed step had been skipped; the failure is recorded but does
  not halt the run.
- `dead_letter`: the flow run MUST end immediately with
  `flow_run.status: dead_letter`, distinct from `stop`, so dead-lettered
  runs can be filtered/queried separately from cleanly-stopped ones (an
  operator worklist, matching the existing `SyncDeadLetters` pattern).

@e2e exclude backend error-policy dispatch — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: onError stop halts the run on the failing step

- **GIVEN** a flow's order-20 step has `onError: stop` and its
  `CallService::call()` throws
- **WHEN** the runner processes that step
- **THEN** `flow_run_log` records `stepOrder: 20, status: failed`
- **AND** `flow_run.status` becomes `stopped`
- **AND** no step after order 20 executes

#### Scenario: onError continue proceeds past the failing step

- **GIVEN** the same flow but the order-20 step has `onError: continue`
- **WHEN** the runner processes that step and it throws
- **THEN** `flow_run_log` records `stepOrder: 20, status: failed`
- **AND** the order-30 step still executes
- **AND** `flow_run.status` becomes `completed` if all remaining steps
  succeed

#### Scenario: onError dead_letter marks the run distinctly from stop

- **GIVEN** the same flow but the order-20 step has `onError: dead_letter`
- **WHEN** the runner processes that step and it throws
- **THEN** `flow_run.status` becomes `dead_letter` (not `stopped`)
- **AND** no step after order 20 executes

### Requirement: a flow runs via cron, endpoint rule, event, or manual trigger (REQ-007)

The system MUST support triggering `FlowRunnerService::run()` from four
surfaces, each reusing an existing trigger mechanism rather than
introducing a new scheduler: (a) a cron-scheduled `job` OR object whose
`jobClass` is `OCA\Integriq\Action\FlowAction`, resolved and
`run($arguments)`-invoked by `JobService::executeJob()` exactly as any
other job action; (b) a `flow` rule action type added to
`EndpointService::processRules()`'s existing type dispatch, valid for
either timing, which resolves `configRef` to a `flow` id and calls
`FlowRunnerService::run($flow, data: $data)`; (c) an event-triggered
invocation wired through the existing `EventService` subscriber delivery
path, matching a configured CloudEvent type/source/subject to a `flow` id
and calling `FlowRunnerService::run()`; (d) a manual "Run" action on the
Flow detail page calling `POST /api/flows/{id}/run`, which invokes
`FlowRunnerService::run()` synchronously and returns the resulting
`flow_run`.

@e2e exclude backend job/rule/event trigger wiring — covered by PHPUnit/Newman, not browser UI (manual-trigger UI is covered under REQ-009)

#### Scenario: a cron job triggers a flow

- **GIVEN** an enabled `job` OR object with `jobClass:
  'OCA\Integriq\Action\FlowAction'` and `arguments: { flowId: '<uuid>' }`
- **WHEN** `JobService::run()` sweeps due jobs and calls
  `FlowAction::run($arguments)`
- **THEN** `FlowRunnerService::run()` is invoked for the referenced flow
- **AND** a `job_log` entry is written summarising the flow run's outcome

#### Scenario: an endpoint rule triggers a flow

- **GIVEN** an endpoint with a rule of `type: flow`, `configRef: <flow
  uuid>`
- **WHEN** the endpoint's rule pipeline reaches that rule and its
  condition (if any) passes
- **THEN** `FlowRunnerService::run($flow, data: $data)` is invoked with
  the current pipeline data as the flow's initial input

#### Scenario: manual run triggers a flow synchronously

- **GIVEN** an admin viewing the Flow detail page for an enabled flow
- **WHEN** they click "Run"
- **THEN** `POST /api/flows/{id}/run` is called
- **AND** `FlowRunnerService::run()` executes synchronously and the
  response carries the resulting `flow_run`'s status and `flow_run_log`

### Requirement: flow runs are persisted with a per-step trace (REQ-008)

Every `FlowRunnerService::run()` invocation MUST create a `flow_run` OR
object (register `openconnector`, schema `flow_run`) carrying `flowId`,
`triggerSource` (`cron` | `endpoint` | `event` | `manual`), `status`
(`running` | `completed` | `stopped` | `dead_letter` | `suspended`),
`startedAt`, `finishedAt`. Each step execution (including skipped steps,
per REQ-003) MUST append a `flow_run_log` entry with `stepOrder`, `type`,
`status` (`completed` | `skipped` | `failed`), `startedAt`, `finishedAt`,
and `error` (present only when `status: failed`).

@e2e exclude backend trace persistence — covered by PHPUnit, not browser UI

#### Scenario: a completed run's log reflects every step outcome

- **GIVEN** the 3-step flow from REQ-001 where the order-20 step's
  condition is false
- **WHEN** the flow run completes
- **THEN** `flow_run_log` contains three entries: order 10 `completed`,
  order 20 `skipped`, order 30 `completed`
- **AND** `flow_run.status` is `completed`
- **AND** `flow_run.finishedAt` is set

### Requirement: Flows index and detail UI provide a typed step-list editor (REQ-009)

Integriq MUST provide a `Flows` section in its SPA: an index page
(`type: index`, listing `name`, `isEnabled`, last-run status/time) and a
detail page (`type: custom`, component `FlowDetailPage`) where an admin
can add, remove, reorder, and configure steps. Each step row MUST use an
`NcSelect` for `type` and, where applicable, `configRef` and `onError`,
each with an explicit `inputLabel` (WCAG 2.1 AA 1.3.1/4.1.2 — matching
the codebase's `EditEndpoint.vue` pattern, not `EditSynchronization.vue`'s
non-conformant one). The step list MUST support add, remove, and reorder
via move-up/move-down controls, which remain a valid authoring surface for
linear flows and MUST stay keyboard-operable regardless of any canvas.
Any modal used by the Flow pages MUST live in its own file under
`src/modals/Flow/`, not inline in the page component.

**Graph editing (revised 2026-07-16, per ADR-065).** This requirement
previously read *"the editor MUST NOT implement drag-and-drop or a
node-graph canvas in this version"*. That prohibition is **withdrawn**: it
was a reasonable v1 scope constraint, but it now contradicts the fleet
decision that a canvas is the standard flow-authoring surface. It is
replaced by a uniformity rule:

- Integriq MUST NOT hand-roll a node-graph canvas. If and when the
  Flow pages offer graph editing, they MUST consume `CnGraphCanvas` from
  `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` (ADR-065), which owns geometry and
  interaction only; step semantics stay app-owned.
- A canvas MUST NOT be the sole authoring surface. The typed step list is
  the accessible path and the fallback (WCAG 2.1 AA 2.1.1 — a
  drag-only editor is not keyboard-operable).
- Adopting a canvas over the current model requires resolving `order`
  first. `order` is simultaneously step identity, execution sequence, and
  the implicit edge set, and `branches[].nextStepOrder` /
  `defaultNextStepOrder` reference it **by value** — so a dragged edge can
  silently invalidate every branch target in the flow. A canvas MUST NOT
  ship against the `order`-as-identity model until edges are explicit.
  This is tracked by the engine relocation to OpenRegister (ADR-065), not
  by a local workaround.

#### Scenario: Flows index page mounts and lists flows

- **GIVEN** an authenticated admin visits the integriq app
- **WHEN** they navigate to the Flows section via the sidebar nav or
  direct URL `/apps/integriq/flows`
- **THEN** the Flows index page renders inside the main content area,
  listing each flow's name, enabled state, and last-run status

#### Scenario: the step-list editor adds a step with a typed config picker

- **GIVEN** an admin on the Flow detail page for an existing flow
- **WHEN** they click "Add step", select `type: mapping` from the step
  type `NcSelect`, and then open the config-ref picker
- **THEN** the config-ref picker's options are scoped to existing
  Mapping entities only (not Sources, Synchronizations, or Endpoints)
- @e2e exclude the flow EDITOR interactions. `spec-coverage/flow-orchestration.spec.ts` covers the index listing, the canvas render, a failed trace timeline and the Replay confirmation, and stops short of the editor's own save-validation, step picker and reordering. Uncovered rather than covered elsewhere

#### Scenario: reordering is possible without a pointer drag

- **GIVEN** a flow with three steps
- **WHEN** the admin clicks "Move up" on the second step
- **THEN** the second step's `order` value is swapped with the first
  step's `order` value
- **AND** the reorder is achievable by keyboard alone, with no
  drag-and-drop interaction required
- @e2e exclude the flow EDITOR interactions. `spec-coverage/flow-orchestration.spec.ts` covers the index listing, the canvas render, a failed trace timeline and the Replay confirmation, and stops short of the editor's own save-validation, step picker and reordering. Uncovered rather than covered elsewhere

#### Scenario: graph editing, if offered, reuses the shared canvas

- **GIVEN** the Flow detail page offers a graph view of a flow
- **WHEN** the page renders that view
- **THEN** it renders `CnGraphCanvas` from `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`
  rather than a component-local node-graph implementation
- **AND** the typed step list remains reachable as the keyboard-operable
  authoring surface for the same flow

@e2e exclude graph view not yet offered — the canvas is introduced with the
OpenRegister engine relocation (ADR-065); this scenario becomes testable when
the Flow pages gain a graph view, and the step-list scenarios above cover the
current UI


### Requirement: The Flow detail page is a draft editor, not a live one (REQ-010)

The Flow detail page MUST edit a **draft** copy and never write on keystroke.
It MUST track whether the draft differs from what was loaded, offer Save and
Discard only while it does, and restore the loaded values on Discard.

The difference MUST be computed against a NORMALISED copy of both sides, so a
field the server materialises (a default filled in, a step re-serialised) does
not read as an operator edit. A page that reports itself dirty on load teaches
its user to ignore the indicator.

Navigating the page to a different flow id MUST reload it. The previous flow's
draft MUST NOT survive that navigation — an editor holding flow A's steps
while the route says flow B will PUT A's steps over B on the next save.

#### Scenario: an untouched flow offers nothing to save

- **GIVEN** an admin opens a flow that has just been loaded
- **WHEN** they have made no edit
- **THEN** no Save or Discard control is offered
- @e2e flow-orchestration::an-untouched-flow-offers-nothing-to-save

#### Scenario: Discard restores the loaded flow

- **GIVEN** an admin has renamed a flow and added a step without saving
- **WHEN** they Discard
- **THEN** the name and the step list return to what was loaded
- **AND** Save and Discard are no longer offered
- @e2e exclude requires a seeded flow with steps and a multi-field edit —
  covered by the store's unit tests

#### Scenario: switching flows does not carry the draft across

- **GIVEN** an admin has an unsaved edit on flow A
- **WHEN** the route changes to flow B
- **THEN** flow B is loaded from the server and the editor shows B's steps
- **AND** a subsequent save writes B, never A
- @e2e exclude needs two seeded flows and a route change mid-edit — covered by
  the store's unit tests

### Requirement: A flow is validated before it can be saved (REQ-011)

The detail page MUST validate the draft locally and refuse to enable Save
while a validation error stands. At minimum it MUST require a non-empty name,
and MUST report every error it found rather than the first.

Validation MUST NOT be the only gate — the server remains authoritative — but
an operator MUST NOT be able to submit a flow the engine will certainly
reject.

#### Scenario: a flow with no name cannot be saved

- **GIVEN** an admin has cleared a flow's name
- **WHEN** they look for the Save control
- **THEN** Save is disabled, or not offered
- @e2e flow-orchestration::a-flow-with-no-name-cannot-be-saved

### Requirement: A flow can be run from its detail page, and its last run is visible (REQ-012)

The detail page MUST offer a manual run (REQ-007's manual trigger) and MUST
surface the outcome of the most recent run, distinguishing a successful run
from a failed, stopped, dead-lettered or suspended one — a suspended run is
waiting for an approval (REQ-005), not broken, and MUST NOT be presented as
an error.

#### Scenario: an operator runs a flow from its detail page

- **GIVEN** an admin on the detail page of a runnable, enabled flow
- **WHEN** they trigger a manual run
- **THEN** a flow run is created for that flow
- **AND** its status is reflected on the page without a reload
- @e2e exclude needs a runnable seeded flow and a run to complete, which the e2e
  seed does not build. Covered by the engine's unit tests only.

#### Scenario: a suspended run is not shown as a failure

- **GIVEN** a flow whose most recent run is suspended at an approval step
- **WHEN** the detail page renders its last-run state
- **THEN** it is presented as awaiting action, not as an error
- @e2e exclude requires an approval-suspended run — covered by the engine's
  unit tests

### Requirement: The step row authors the same conditions the engine evaluates (REQ-013)

A step row MUST let an admin author the step's `condition` (REQ-003) and, for
a `branch` step, its `branches[]` (REQ-004), through the shared JsonLogic
condition builder rather than a free-text JSON box.

A branch's target MUST be chosen from the flow's existing step orders, not
typed: `branches[].nextStepOrder` references a step **by value**, so a typed
number can name a step that does not exist and the flow fails only at run
time.

An empty or absent condition MUST round-trip as absent, not as an empty
object — the engine treats absent as "always run", and `{}` is not the same
document.

#### Scenario: a branch target is picked from the flow's own steps

- **GIVEN** an admin editing a `branch` step in a flow with three steps
- **WHEN** they add a branch and open its target picker
- **THEN** the options are the flow's existing step orders
- @e2e exclude needs a seeded multi-step branch flow — covered by the step
  row's unit tests

#### Scenario: clearing a condition removes it rather than storing an empty one

- **GIVEN** a step that has a condition
- **WHEN** the admin clears every clause
- **THEN** the saved step carries no `condition` key
- @e2e exclude a serialisation invariant with no visible surface — covered by
  the step row's unit tests

### Requirement: A flow's run history is inspectable per step (REQ-014)

The Flow detail page MUST offer the run history REQ-008 persists: the runs of
that flow, most recent first, each expandable to its per-step log with each
step's type, status and error.

Step logs MUST be fetched when a run is expanded, not for every run on load —
a flow with a long history would otherwise issue one request per run before
the operator has asked for any of them.

#### Scenario: an operator expands a run to see its steps

- **GIVEN** a flow with at least one recorded run
- **WHEN** the admin expands that run in the run log
- **THEN** the run's per-step entries are fetched and listed with their type,
  status and any error
- @e2e exclude needs a flow with recorded runs, which the e2e seed does not
  create. Covered by the engine's unit tests only.

#### Scenario: an empty history says so

- **GIVEN** a flow that has never run
- **WHEN** the admin opens its run log
- **THEN** an empty state is shown rather than an empty list
- @e2e exclude the empty run-log state has no e2e covering it.

### Requirement: A node that calls a Source once per item dispatches those calls concurrently (REQ-015)

`SourceCallNode` makes one outbound request per flow item. Done serially, a
step over N items costs N sequential round-trips — which would make a
flow-based read measurably SLOWER than the bespoke synchronisation reader it
replaces, and that reader already settles its fetches behind a concurrency cap
(`FETCH_CONCURRENCY_DEFAULT` = 5, `FETCH_CONCURRENCY_MAX` = 20).

The node therefore dispatches through `CallService::callAsync()` — the sibling
that shares every auth, guard, certificate and logging phase with `call()` and
finalises through the same `finalizeCall()`, so an asynchronous call produces
the same CallLog row (ADR-003) — and settles the promises through
OpenRegister's `FlowConcurrency`, which owns the bound, the ordering and the
per-item isolation.

The step's authored `concurrency` key selects the cap; unset means the shared
default rather than one, because a flow-based read that silently ran serially
would be the regression this requirement exists to prevent.

#### Scenario: the calls actually go out concurrently

- **GIVEN** a flow step over six items whose responses have not yet settled
- **WHEN** the node executes
- **THEN** more than one call is in flight at once, up to the shared default
- @e2e exclude an in-flight peak is not observable from a browser; asserted in
  `tests/Unit/Flow/SourceCallNodeTest.php` against unsettled promises, with a
  positive control that reports a peak of one when dispatch is made serial

#### Scenario: the authored limit bounds the fan-out and the output keeps input order

- **GIVEN** a step over nine items with `concurrency: 2`
- **WHEN** the responses settle in an order other than the order dispatched
- **THEN** at most two calls are ever in flight, and each item receives its OWN
  response with `pairedItem` intact and the output in INPUT order
- @e2e exclude same measurement; a run log ordered by whichever upstream
  answered first is not comparable between two runs of the same flow

#### Scenario: one item's failure leaves the others their results

- **GIVEN** a step whose second of two calls fails
- **WHEN** the step's `onError` policy is `continue`
- **THEN** the failing item carries the error record and the succeeding item
  keeps its response, exactly as it did when the node looped
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Unit/Flow/SourceCallNodeTest.php`

#### Scenario: an out-of-bounds endpoint on a later item prevents every call

- **GIVEN** a step over three items whose THIRD item renders an endpoint that
  escapes the Source location
- **WHEN** the step executes
- **THEN** containment is refused and NO request is dispatched for any item —
  the render-and-guard pass completes before dispatch begins, so the refusal
  cannot be demoted into a per-item `continue` nor arrive after calls are
  already in flight
- @e2e exclude a security guard's refusal is asserted at the unit boundary

### Requirement: A node contributes its own run-log links (REQ-016)

A run log entry written by `SourceCallNode` concerns integriq records —
the Source that was called and the CallLog that was written — which OpenRegister
cannot know about. The node therefore implements OpenRegister's
`IFlowNodeLogActions` and answers with its own links, resolved from the entry's
recorded OUTPUT (`sourceId`, `callLog`).

Links are resolved at READ time rather than stored: an href written into a log
months ago points wherever this app's routes were then. They are hash fragments
because the frontend is a hash-routed SPA, and they open in a NEW tab because
the editor holds unsaved state.

#### Scenario: a call's log entry offers its source and its call log

- **GIVEN** a completed `openconnector.source-call` entry recording a `sourceId`
  and a `callLog`
- **WHEN** the engine asks the node for that entry's actions
- **THEN** links to the Source and to the CallLog are returned
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Unit/Flow/SourceCallNodeTest.php`

#### Scenario: an entry from another node type earns nothing

- **GIVEN** a log entry written by a node this app does not own
- **WHEN** the engine asks this node for its actions
- **THEN** no links are returned, rather than links built from absent ids
- @e2e exclude covered by `tests/Unit/Flow/SourceCallNodeTest.php`

### Requirement: Integriq's Flow pages are the shared canvas over the one native flow store (REQ-017)

Integriq MUST NOT own a second flow-authoring surface. Its Flow pages are thin scopings of
the components `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` already ships over OpenRegister's one native flow
store (ADR-065): `CnFlowIndexPage` for the index, `CnFlowDetail` for the canvas, and
`CnFlowSidebar` for the controls. This supersedes REQ-009's bespoke ordered step-list editor
**for this app's own pages** — REQ-009's uniformity and keyboard-operability rules continue to
bind whatever those shared components render.

The index page MUST pass `app="openconnector"` so this app sees only its own flows.
OpenRegister's Flows page passes no app filter and is the fleet-wide surface; this is the
leaf-app one, and the two MUST NOT be conflated.

The controls MUST live in a separate `FlowDetailSidebar` component rendered into Nextcloud's app
sidebar via the manifest's `sidebarComponent`, not inside the canvas page, so the canvas keeps
the full width. The sidebar and the canvas MUST share state through `useFlowStore` rather than
through props: one store is what makes every app's sidebar behave identically.

Save and run MUST go through that shared store — `store.save()` and `store.run({})` — and
Integriq MUST add no flow-writing path of its own. After a save that CREATES a flow, the
route MUST be replaced with the server-assigned id: the create route is `/flows/new`, and
leaving it there would send a reload back to an empty new-flow shell instead of the flow the
operator just created.

#### Scenario: The flows index lists only this app's flows

- **GIVEN** a flow seeded with `app: "openconnector"`
- **WHEN** an admin opens the app's `/flows` route
- **THEN** that flow is listed by name
- @e2e flow-orchestration::the-flows-index-lists-only-this-apps-flows

#### Scenario: Flow detail renders the shared canvas and survives a hard reload

- **GIVEN** a seeded flow with a trigger node and a `openconnector.synchronization-run` node
- **WHEN** an admin opens `/flows/<id>`
- **THEN** the shared canvas mounts bound to that flow, showing its name and both placed nodes
- **AND** a hard document reload of the same URL resolves to the same flow rather than the
  dashboard
- @e2e flow-orchestration::flow-detail-renders-the-shared-canvas
