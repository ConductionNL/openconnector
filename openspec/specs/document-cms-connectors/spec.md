# document-cms-connectors Specification

## Purpose

Document/CMS vendors (SharePoint, OneDrive, Google Drive, Alfresco, Box, etc.)
register as `IntegrationProvider`s under `lib/Service/Adapter/DocumentCms/`,
each extending the shared `AbstractCategoryAdapterProvider`
(`lib/Service/Adapter/AbstractCategoryAdapterProvider.php`).
`SharePointOnlineAdapter` (`lib/Service/Adapter/DocumentCms/SharePointOnlineAdapter.php`)
is the reference implementation, proving `document-list`/`document-fetch`
against Microsoft Graph's `drive` API. To add the next vendor: create a new
class extending `AbstractCategoryAdapterProvider`, implement the
`IntegrationProvider` metadata methods plus vendor-specific document
list/fetch methods via `brokeredRequest()`, and register it in
`Application::registerIntegrationProviders()`.

KNOWN GAP: the reference adapter persists fetched documents into Nextcloud's
own Files storage (`IRootFolder`), not into a dedicated docudesk
attachment-ingestion endpoint — no such public route currently exists in the
docudesk app. Wiring a real docudesk hand-off is deferred as a follow-up, not
invented against a route that doesn't exist. The remaining named vendors
stay explicit backlog (see
`openspec/changes/connector-category-adapter-scaffolding`).

## Requirements
### Requirement: Document/CMS connector adapters SHALL register through the integration registry per ADR-019 and target EXTERNAL document systems only (REQ-DCC-001)

Document/CMS connector adapters MUST register through the integration
registry per ADR-019 and target external document systems only.
Every adapter for an external document-management or
content-management system — Microsoft SharePoint Online,
SharePoint Server, Microsoft OneDrive (business + consumer),
Google Drive (workspace + consumer), Alfresco, OpenText
Documentum, M-Files, Box, Hyland OnBase, Nuxeo, and the
NL government surfaces VIP-files (per VNG GEMMA) and NLX
brokered document services — MUST be implemented as an
`IntegrationProvider` registered through OR's integration
registry per ADR-019. Adapter classes MUST live under
`lib/Service/Adapter/DocumentCms/`.

This spec scopes EXTERNAL DMS connectors only. Any document
storage on the Conduction side MUST be consumed from docudesk
per ADR-022; integriq MUST NOT re-implement file storage,
metadata indexing, or retention. A document fetched from
SharePoint and persisted on the Conduction side lands as a
docudesk attachment via the existing docudesk file API; the
DCC adapter is the transport, docudesk is the home.

#### Scenario: Reviewer confirms no Conduction-side document store in integriq

- **GIVEN** the integriq codebase under
  `lib/Service/Adapter/DocumentCms/`
- **WHEN** scanned for persistence calls into
  `OCP\Files\IRootFolder`, `OCA\OpenRegister\Db\FileMapper`,
  or any locally authored `Document*Mapper` class
- **THEN** no such calls SHALL exist; documents that need to
  land on the Conduction side MUST go through docudesk's file
  API (per ADR-022).
- @e2e exclude a review checklist, not a behaviour. It asks a REVIEWER to confirm something about SIBLING APPS' source, which is neither a DOM behaviour nor even a fact about this repository

#### Scenario: Reviewer confirms no per-app DMS HTTP client in sibling apps

- **GIVEN** any sibling app's `lib/Service/` tree
- **WHEN** scanned for `Microsoft\Graph\\*`, `Google\Service\Drive`,
  `Box\\*`, `Alfresco\\*`, or any SharePoint REST client
- **THEN** no such imports SHALL exist; DMS access MUST route
  through integriq by integration slot slug.
- @e2e exclude a review checklist, not a behaviour. It asks a REVIEWER to confirm something about SIBLING APPS' source, which is neither a DOM behaviour nor even a fact about this repository

### Requirement: Each DCC adapter manifest entry SHALL declare the four canonical capabilities — file-crud, metadata-sync, search-federation, acl-bridging — with explicit support flags (REQ-DCC-002)

Every DCC adapter MUST publish a manifest entry per ADR-024
(extending the REQ-DIC-002 shape) with `category: document-cms`
and a `capabilities[]` array drawn from the canonical set:

| Capability | Meaning | Typical underlying API |
|---|---|---|
| `file-crud` | Create, read, update, delete files in the remote DMS | SharePoint Files API, Drive Files API, Alfresco CMIS |
| `file-versioning` | Read version history; read previous versions; create new versions | DMS-native version endpoints |
| `metadata-sync` | Read + write document properties (title, author, tags, content type, custom fields) | DMS property/property-bag APIs |
| `search-federation` | Issue federated search queries against the remote DMS and return normalised hits | DMS search APIs (KQL, Drive query, CMIS Query Language) |
| `acl-bridging` | Read remote ACLs and surface them as OR RBAC subjects/groups; OPTIONALLY translate Conduction-side RBAC writes into remote ACL changes when the operator opts in | DMS permission APIs |
| `event-subscribe` | Subscribe to remote change events (file added/modified/deleted/permission-changed) | Graph change-notifications, Drive push, CMIS browser events |
| `checkin-checkout` | Acquire/release editing locks on remote files | DMS lock/unlock endpoints |

Capabilities a given DMS does not support MUST be omitted —
adapters MUST NOT claim a capability they cannot fulfil. The
manifest validator MUST reject any unknown capability literal.

#### Scenario: A SharePoint adapter declares the full canonical capability set

- **GIVEN** the SharePoint adapter manifest entry
- **WHEN** inspected
- **THEN** `capabilities[]` SHALL include `file-crud`,
- @e2e exclude a static or manifest-shape assertion, not a DOM behaviour
  `file-versioning`, `metadata-sync`, `search-federation`,
  `acl-bridging`, `event-subscribe`, `checkin-checkout`.

#### Scenario: An NLX-brokered adapter omits capabilities it cannot fulfil

- **GIVEN** the NLX adapter manifest entry, which fronts a
  read-only brokered service
- **WHEN** inspected
- **THEN** `capabilities[]` SHALL include `file-crud` (read
  only — verified by the adapter's REQ-DCC-005 read-only flag),
  `metadata-sync` (read only), `search-federation`; and MUST
  NOT include `acl-bridging` (NLX does not surface upstream
  ACLs) or `checkin-checkout`.
- @e2e exclude the adapter this names does not exist. Verified 2026-09-07: each connector family ships exactly ONE reference adapter (Saas: Microsoft365Adapter, DocumentCms: SharePointOnlineAdapter, EndpointWorkspace: AzureVirtualDesktopAdapter, DataInfra: S3Adapter), and no file under lib/ carries the adapter named here. The scenario is forward-looking rather than unmet

### Requirement: ACL bridging SHALL be read-by-default; write-side ACL propagation is opt-in per source (REQ-DCC-003)

ACL bridging MUST be read-by-default. Per ADR-005 (security) and ADR-022 (apps consume OR
abstractions), ACL bridging MUST default to read-only — the
adapter surfaces remote ACLs as OR RBAC subjects so a sibling
app can render "Jan has read access in SharePoint" without
modifying the remote DMS. Write-side propagation
(Conduction-side RBAC change → remote ACL change) is OPT-IN
per `Source` record via an `aclWriteBack: boolean` setting on
the source's configuration JSON (stored in integriq, not
in any sibling app).

When `aclWriteBack: false` (the default), any caller invoking
the adapter's `setRemoteAcl()` method MUST receive a
`AclWriteDisabledException` and the call MUST NOT mutate
remote state. The adapter MUST log the rejected attempt
through integriq's existing CallLog.

#### Scenario: Default source rejects ACL write-back

- **GIVEN** a freshly configured SharePoint source with no
  `aclWriteBack` override
- **WHEN** a sibling app invokes `setRemoteAcl(...)` via the
  adapter
- **THEN** the call MUST throw `AclWriteDisabledException`;
  **AND** an entry MUST land in the existing integriq
  `CallLog` table with outcome `rejected-acl-write-disabled`.
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session

#### Scenario: Operator opts in and ACL write-back succeeds

- **GIVEN** an operator sets `aclWriteBack: true` on the source
- **WHEN** the same `setRemoteAcl(...)` call runs
- **THEN** the remote DMS MUST receive the ACL change; **AND**
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session
  the audit trail on the source MUST record the operator who
  enabled write-back and the date of enablement.

### Requirement: Search federation SHALL normalise hits into a shared result envelope so multiple DMS can be queried side-by-side (REQ-DCC-004)

Search federation MUST normalise hits into a shared result envelope.
A sibling app issuing a federated search against multiple DMS
sources at once MUST receive a uniform result shape regardless
of underlying API. Each hit MUST carry:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sourceSlug` | string | Which integriq source returned the hit |
| `remoteId` | string | The DMS's native identifier |
| `title` | string | Document title |
| `mimeType` | string | Normalised MIME type |
| `sizeBytes` | integer or null | File size when known |
| `modifiedAt` | date-time | Remote last-modified timestamp |
| `modifiedByLabel` | string or null | Best-available actor label (display name); MUST NOT contain a credential |
| `path` | string or null | Remote path/folder reference (best-effort) |
| `previewUrl` | string (URL) or null | URL into the remote DMS for preview |
| `snippet` | string or null | Search-engine-generated excerpt |
| `score` | number (0..1) | Normalised relevance score across sources |

Adapter authors MUST implement the per-DMS hit-to-envelope
mapping; consuming apps MUST consume only this normalised
shape. Per ADR-022, the normalisation logic lives in
integriq (one place per DMS) — sibling apps MUST NOT
reach into DMS-native response shapes.

#### Scenario: Federated query across two DMS returns one merged envelope shape

- **GIVEN** an operator has configured both a SharePoint and an
  Alfresco source
- **WHEN** a sibling app issues a federated search for
  `"contract addendum"` across both
- **THEN** every returned hit MUST conform to the envelope
  above regardless of source; `sourceSlug` MUST distinguish
  the two; `score` MUST be normalised to `0..1` so the
  caller can merge-sort.
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session

### Requirement: Each adapter SHALL declare a `readOnly` posture per source so reviewers can audit blast radius (REQ-DCC-005)

Per ADR-005, the adapter manifest entry MUST declare a
`defaultReadOnly: boolean` field. Per-source overrides live on
the integriq source record's configuration JSON. When
`readOnly: true`, the adapter MUST reject every method whose
effect on the remote system is mutative
(`createFile`, `updateFile`, `deleteFile`, `setMetadata`,
`setRemoteAcl`, `checkOut`, `checkIn`, `subscribe` when the
subscribe creates remote state) with a
`ReadOnlySourceException`.

This gives operators a one-line audit answer: "what is the
blast radius of this source?" If `readOnly: true`, the answer
is "nothing — read-only by construction." If `readOnly: false`,
the answer is the list of mutative methods the adapter exposes,
which is itself derivable from the manifest's `capabilities[]`.

#### Scenario: A read-only NLX source rejects write attempts

- **GIVEN** an NLX source configured with `readOnly: true`
  (the default for NLX adapters)
- **WHEN** any caller invokes `createFile(...)` via the adapter
- **THEN** the call MUST throw `ReadOnlySourceException`; **AND**
  no remote-side state SHALL change; **AND** the rejection MUST
  land in CallLog.
- @e2e exclude the adapter this names does not exist. Verified 2026-09-07: each connector family ships exactly ONE reference adapter (Saas: Microsoft365Adapter, DocumentCms: SharePointOnlineAdapter, EndpointWorkspace: AzureVirtualDesktopAdapter, DataInfra: S3Adapter), and no file under lib/ carries the adapter named here. The scenario is forward-looking rather than unmet

### Requirement: Documents persisted on the Conduction side from a DCC adapter SHALL land as docudesk attachments referenced by URI, never as integriq-owned files (REQ-DCC-006)

Documents persisted on the Conduction side MUST land as docudesk attachments.
When a sibling app's workflow needs to retain a document
fetched from an external DMS (rather than streaming on demand),
the persistence MUST go through docudesk's existing file API
per ADR-022. The DCC adapter's job ends at returning the file
contents + the normalised metadata envelope; persistence is the
caller's choice and the caller routes it through docudesk.

The OR object that retained the document MUST reference the
docudesk attachment by URI; the DCC adapter MUST NOT store the
bytes anywhere itself beyond the request-scoped transfer buffer.

#### Scenario: A workflow stores a SharePoint contract as a docudesk attachment

- **GIVEN** a workflow that fetches a contract PDF from
  SharePoint via the adapter
- **WHEN** the workflow persists the file
- **THEN** the file bytes MUST be POSTed to docudesk's file
  endpoint; the OR object MUST carry a docudesk URI; no file
  bytes SHALL be written under integriq's app data or
  any integriq-owned table.
- @e2e exclude driving this needs the external SaaS tenant the adapter talks to. The e2e instance has no such credentials and no such account, so the call cannot be made from a browser session

### Requirement: Individual per-DMS adapters are explicitly out of scope for this spec — each adapter MUST ship in its own `add-openconnector-{slug}-adapter` change (REQ-DCC-007)

Individual per-DMS adapter implementations MUST be out of scope for this spec.
Per the same pattern as REQ-DIC-007, individual DMS adapter
implementations (e.g. SharePoint, Alfresco, NLX, VIP-files)
MUST land as separate openspec changes named
`add-openconnector-{slug}-adapter`, each consuming this spec
by REQ reference. Per-adapter changes MUST cite REQ-DCC-001
through REQ-DCC-006 in their proposal and MUST NOT re-derive
the category-level contract.

#### Scenario: A new SharePoint adapter change references this spec

- **GIVEN** a new change folder
  `openspec/changes/add-openconnector-sharepoint-adapter/`
- **WHEN** its proposal.md is inspected
- **THEN** the `Depends on` line MUST include
  `document-cms-connectors (integriq)` and
  `docudesk` (for the persistence path); the proposal MUST
  cite REQ-DCC-002 (capabilities), REQ-DCC-004 (search
  envelope), and REQ-DCC-006 (docudesk persistence) by REQ id.
- @e2e exclude a process rule for FUTURE changes: it asks that a not-yet-written change reference this spec. There is nothing to drive until that change exists
