# Welcome

OpenConnector is a key component in the Nextcloud-based architecture developed by Conduction. It serves as the interface for external systems to connect with the Nextcloud environment. Together with **OpenRegister** (for storing data) and **OpenCatalogi** (for publishing data in a federated network), OpenConnector forms a robust and scalable trio for managing, sharing, and federating information across platforms.

This GitBook outlines the functionalities, architecture, and usage of OpenConnector, enabling seamless integration and efficient data flow between external systems and the Nextcloud ecosystem.
