 # Applications

Applications represent external servers that are allowed to make calls to the connector. They are part of the vault and consists of two major parts authentication and authorization.

## Authentication

Authentication describes the procces of making sure that the call comes from an valid application, and establiiching wich application the call is comming from. Or put more simply: Its about making sure that the call is authentic. We can do this in several ways, wich can also be combined. But they all have in common that the application that makes the call needs to prove its authenticity.

## Authorization

Authorization describes the process of making sure that the application is allowed to make the specific call to the external service. Or put more simply: Its about making sure that the application is authorized to make the call. E.g. may the application read data from the external service or may it write data to the external service.
