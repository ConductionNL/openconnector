# Synchronization

Synchronization is a core feature that enables data transfer between different systems and APIs. Here's how it works:

## Overview
- Synchronizations define how data should be synchronized between a source and target system
- Each synchronization has a source configuration (where to get data from) and target configuration (where to send data to)
- The synchronization process handles pagination, data mapping, and maintaining sync state

## Key Components

### Source Configuration
- Defines where to fetch data from (API endpoint, database etc)
- Specifies how to map source data to target format (incomming data)
- Specifies how to locate objects in the response using resultsPosition:
  - `_root`: Uses the entire response body as the objects array
  - Dot notation (e.g. `data.items`): Extracts objects from a nested path
  - Common keys (`items`, `result`, `results`): Automatically checks these standard locations
  - Custom path: Specify any JSON path to locate the objects
- Configures pagination settings (paginationQuery)
- Can include conditions to filter which objects to sync using JSON Logic
- Source type can be set to API or other supported types
- Source ID mapping allows specifying position of IDs in source objects
- Optional endpoint configuration for fetching data
- usesPagination: configure this field if you know this source **does not** uses pagination or next endpoint. Use value "false". If this source uses next endpoint it will auto detect.
- Optional configuration of sub objects.

#### Related or sub objects

If you don't want mapped related- or sub- objects to duplicate and have their own contracts you need to let the synchronization know.
You can configure this under the source configuration of a synchronization.

The synchronization know knows we need to find and update a existing contract for zaaktype and the zaaktype its own sub object statustype. The contract can find the related object and update that object instead of duplicating objects each time the synchronization has ran.

Also make sure you first map a `originId` in the mapping of a sub object so the code can find this object and update it instead of duplicate it.

### Target Configuration
- Defines where to send synchronized data
- Specifies how to map target data to source format (outgoing data)
- Handles create/update/delete operations
- Target type can be Register/Schema or other supported types
- Target ID and schema selection for Register/Schema targets
- Target source mapping for data transformations

### Synchronization Contracts
- Tracks the sync state for each individual object
- Stores origin ID and target ID mappings
- Maintains hashes to detect changes
- Logs synchronization events and errors

## Process Flow
1. Fetch all objects from source system with pagination
2. Determining if an object has changed
3. Create/update synchronization contracts for each object
4. Transform data according to mapping rules
5. Write objects to target system (POST/PUT/DELETE)
6. Update contract status and hashes
7. Handle any follow-up synchronizations

### Determining if an object has changed
The synchronization service prevents unnecessary updates and code execution by checking the following conditions:

1. The origin hash matches the stored hash in the synchronization contract (indicating the source object hasn't changed)
2. The synchronization configuration hasn't been updated since the last check (synchronization.updated < contract.sourceLastChecked)
3. If a source target mapping exists, verify it hasn't been updated since the last check (mapping.updated < contract.sourceLastChecked)
4. The target ID and hash exist in the synchronization contract (object hasn't been removed from target system)
5. The force parameter is false (if true, the update will proceed regardless of other conditions)

If all these conditions are met, the synchronization service will skip updating the object since no changes are needed. This optimization prevents unnecessary API calls and processing.

This procces might be overridden by the user by setting the force option to true. In that case the synchronization service will update the target object regardless of whether it has changed or not.

## Error Handling
- Rate limiting detection and backoff
- Logging of failed operations
- Contract state tracking for retry attempts

The synchronization system provides a robust way to keep data in sync across different systems while maintaining state and handling errors gracefully.

## Form Configuration
The synchronization form allows configuring:

- Name: Descriptive name for the synchronization
- Description: Optional details about the synchronization
- Conditions: JSON Logic conditions for filtering objects
- Source Configuration:
  - Source Type: API or other supported types
  - Source ID: Selection of configured source
  - Source hash mapping: Hash configuration
  - Source target mapping: Data mapping rules
  - Position of ID in source object (optional)
  - Position of results in source object (optional)
  - Custom endpoint for data fetching (optional)
- Target Configuration:
  - Target Type: Register/Schema or other types
  - Target ID: Selection of target system
  - Register and Schema selection for Register/Schema targets
  - Target source mapping: Data transformation rules
- Test sync option to validate configuration
