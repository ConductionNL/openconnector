/**
 * l10n extraction / drift check — FRONTEND catalogue.
 *
 * Scans the frontend source for translation calls — t('<app>', '...'),
 * n('<app>', '...', '...', n) and the $t/$n template variants — and asserts
 * every literal source string is present as a key in l10n/en.js.
 *
 * ## Why en.js and not en.json
 *
 * The two translation sets are separate catalogues with separate consumers:
 *
 *   l10n/*.js    FRONTEND   OC.L10N.register -> t() / n()   (loaded by the browser)
 *   l10n/*.json  BACKEND    PHP IL10N -> $l->t()
 *
 * They are not two renderings of one source. This check previously asserted
 * frontend t() literals against l10n/en.json, which no frontend code path ever
 * reads — so it demanded bookkeeping in a backend file while the catalogue the
 * browser actually loads went unaudited (en.js was ~700 keys behind src/, and
 * nothing noticed because a missing key makes OC.L10N fall back to the English
 * source string, which renders correctly).
 *
 * The backend .json set is a separate concern. There is no scanner for it yet:
 * it would need to walk lib/ for PHP $l->t() calls, not src/.
 *
 * ## Plurals
 *
 * An n() call has TWO source strings but only ONE catalogue key — the singular.
 * The plural lives in that key's value as an array of the locale's nplurals
 * forms. So the plural source is never itself a required key, and --write emits
 * `[singular, plural]` for an n() key rather than a bare string (a string value
 * on a plural key renders blank at runtime).
 *
 * Extraction is delegated to scripts/lib/l10n.js (vendored from openregister),
 * which reads real string literals — decoding \u/\x escapes and rejecting
 * concatenations and template interpolations — instead of pattern-matching.
 * The same lib backs scripts/check-l10n.js, clean-l10n.js and l10n-ai.js, so
 * every tool agrees on what "used" means.
 *
 * Division of labour with scripts/check-l10n.js: that one is the richer
 * developer audit (missing + unused + unwrapped, no write mode); this one is the
 * CI gate (missing only, plus --write extraction).
 *
 * Modes:
 *   (default)  check only — exit non-zero if any used key is missing.
 *   --write    extraction — merge every missing used key into l10n/en.js
 *              (value === the English source, which is correct for `en`:
 *              en IS the source language) and re-serialize in the on-disk
 *              Nextcloud/Transifex layout.
 *   --parity   after a clean check, also run the all-locales parity gate.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0  every used key is present in en.js (or --write made it so)
 *   1  one or more used keys are missing from en.js (hard failure)
 *
 * Env:
 *   L10N_APP_ID   override the app id (default: the id en.js registers)
 *   L10N_SRC_DIR  override the source dir to scan (default: src)
 *   L10N_FILE     override the en.js path (default: l10n/en.js)
