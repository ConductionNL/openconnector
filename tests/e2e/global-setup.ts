 * Playwright globalSetup — logs into Nextcloud once and persists the
 * resulting cookie jar / localStorage to `tests/e2e/.auth/admin.json`.
 * Every spec then reuses that storage state via the `use.storageState`
 * setting in playwright.config.ts, so individual tests start from an
 * authenticated session without each one paying the login cost.
 *
 * Why a real browser login (instead of POSTing to /login directly):
 * Nextcloud's login form ships a CSRF token (`requesttoken`) plus a
 * `oc_session_passphrase` cookie that must be set in the same browser
 * context. Driving the form via Playwright sidesteps having to
 * reverse-engineer the token-rotation contract, which has shifted across
 * NC 28 / 29 / 30.
 *
 * Pattern reference: ADR-030 (hydra/openspec/architecture/), mirrored
 * from decidesk's journeydoc setup.

	// `useSupportDialog` (mode `'server'`, wired by CnAppRoot with
	// `app-id="integriq"`) treats
	// `localStorage['cn-support-dialog-shown:integriq'] === '1'` as the
	// authoritative "already seen" signal and never opens the dialog when it is
	// set. Seeding means the support-dialog `modal-mask` never mounts, so it can
	// never intercept the pointer events that `expandNavGroups` / `navTo` rely
	// on. Seeding also decouples the harness from the server preferences
	// endpoint: on a fresh browser with no flag, a non-2xx GET of that endpoint
	// sends the composable down its fail-open catch branch and re-opens the
	// dialog on every load.
	//
	// The app id MUST be named explicitly here. `seedSupportDialogSeen(page,
	// '*')` installs a `Storage.prototype.getItem` shim but deliberately skips
	// writing concrete keys, and a shim lives on the page — it does NOT survive
	// into the `storageState` file this setup persists. Passing 'integriq'
	// takes the write-through branch, so the flag rides in storageState and is
	// durable for every spec, context and browser in the run.
	//
	// `seedWalkthroughSeen` is included via seedFirstVisitOverlaysSeen even
	// though this app ships no CnWalkthrough — it is inert here and keeps the
	// harness correct if one is ever added.
	// ⚠️ The `/index.php/` prefix is load-bearing, and this is the worst place
	// to get it wrong. CI serves Nextcloud with `php -S` and no router script,
	// where `/apps/integriq/` is a real directory with no index.php inside
	// and therefore 404s (measured; the pretty form only works behind Apache +
	// `.htaccess`). A 404 page still shares the origin, so the localStorage
	// seed below would appear to succeed — but the page carries no
	// `OC.requestToken`, so the first-run-wizard dismissal a few lines down
	// silently fails, and the wizard then intercepts pointer events in every
	// spec without hiding anything a visibility assertion looks at.

	// Retire Nextcloud's own first-run wizard for this user.
	//
	// The wizard mounts as `#firstrunwizard`, a `[role="dialog"]` carrying
	// `modal-mask--opaque`, and it is the *other* full-screen overlay a fresh
	// instance puts in front of the app — the CnSupportDialog seed above says
	// nothing about it. Its failure mode is the nasty one: it hides nothing that
	// a visibility assertion looks at, so `toBeVisible()` on the page's own
	// buttons keeps passing and only the *click* is intercepted
	// ("subtree intercepts pointer events"). Two specs died exactly that way.
	//
	// Worse, it is itself a `[role="dialog"]`, so a spec that reaches for
	// `getByRole('dialog').first()` after a click that never landed can match the
	// wizard and pass green against the wrong element.
	//
	// `DELETE /apps/firstrunwizard/wizard` is the app's own dismissal route and
	// records the result server-side against this user, so unlike a localStorage
	// seed it holds for every spec, context and browser in the run. Issued from
	// inside the page so the session cookie and CSRF token come along for free.
	// Best-effort: an instance without the wizard app installed simply 404s.
