 * Spec coverage: openspec/specs/api-product-gateway/spec.md
 *
 * Covers the index-mounts scenario. Everything else in that spec is gateway
 * behaviour with no browser surface and stays with PHPUnit/Newman.
 *
 * NOT covered here:
 * `product-detail-page-exposes-an-endpoint-picker-and-tier-editor`. It needs a
 * product to open, a cold instance has none, and both ways of getting one were
 * worse than the gap: skipping on an empty fixture is coverage that never runs
 * (what gate-19 exists to catch), and seeding one made this file fail as a
 * pair while each test passed alone. Left uncovered and visible rather than
 * shipped flaky.
 *
 * ⚠️ The router is now path-mode (`createWebHistory()`, src/main.js,
 * router-history-mode convention — docs/claude/frontend-standards.md
 * #routing-history-mode). A `#` in the URL is now WRONG — it sets
 * `location.hash`, which the router never reads, and the deep-link silently
 * lands on the DASHBOARD instead, which looks like the page failing to
 * render its own content — the same symptom the old hash-mode note warned
 * about, for the opposite reason.
