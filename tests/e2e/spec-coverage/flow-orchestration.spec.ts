 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This file used to cover REQ-009 (the typed step-list editor: FlowStepRow,
 * keyboard reorder, config-ref picker scoped by step type) and REQ-010/011
 * (the draft/dirty Save-Discard contract on that same editor). That UI no
 * longer exists: the `/flows/:id` page is now the shared `flow` page type,
 * which mounts `CnFlowEditorPage` -> `CnFlowDetail` from
 * @conduction/nextcloud-vue over OpenRegister's native flow store
 * (nodes[]/edges[]), not this app's own `flow`/`steps[]` schema the old editor
 * was built on. The app-side wrapper FlowDetailPage.vue is gone with it. See
 * openspec/specs/flow-orchestration/spec.md's 2026-08-16 scope note and
 * integriq#1255 for the full backend-state writeup.
 *
 * The shared canvas's own editor behaviour (dirty tracking, node palette,
 * keyboard operability) is `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`'s to test — duplicating
 * it per consuming app is exactly the kind of coverage that silently drifts
 * from what the shared component actually does. What THIS app still owns and
 * must keep proving: the `/flows` and `/flows/:id` routes exist, resolve to
 * the shared components with the right `app="openconnector"` scoping, and
 * survive a real reload — see the new describe block below.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* COVERED HERE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The index list's exact columns (Name / Trigger / Status, measured
 * 2026-08-16 — a different shape than the old Name/Enabled/Description table
 * integriq#1214 was filed against) are not pinned here. `CnFlowIndexPage`
 * owns that presentation; pinning its column set from a consumer app couples
 * this file to a shared-library layout choice it doesn't control.
 *
 * REQ-007 (execution-trace, Trace detail / Replay) is UNRELATED to this
 * migration — the trace surface never used the old step-list editor — and is
 * unchanged below.
