 * Spec coverage: the sync-editor type-selector rules of
 *   openspec/specs/tables-bridge/spec.md            (REQ-004)
 *   openspec/specs/nextcloud-forms-connector/spec.md (REQ-001, REQ-002)
 *
 * These three scenarios are all of the shape "type X is NOT offered in the
 * selector". An absence assertion is the single easiest thing in a browser
 * suite to satisfy for the wrong reason: a selector that failed to open, a
 * page that never mounted, a locator that matches nothing — every one of them
 * renders "the option is not there" indistinguishably from the requirement
 * being met.
 *
 * So EVERY absence assertion in this file is paired with a positive control
 * that makes the same locator, on the same page, in the same run, produce a
 * match. The controls are not decoration; they are what makes the absence
 * mean anything.
 *
 * The controls come from a real behaviour of the editor rather than from a
 * second fixture that happens to differ. `SynchronizationDetailPage` keeps an
 * ALREADY-CONFIGURED bridge kind in its option list even when the companion
 * app is disabled, so that a stored `nextcloud-table` / `nextcloud-form` sync
 * still renders a label for its own type:
 *
 *     typeOptions()        -> TYPE_OPTIONS + NEXTCLOUD_TABLE_OPTION
 *                             iff tablesEnabled OR the draft already uses it
 *     sourceTypeOptions()  -> typeOptions   + NEXTCLOUD_FORM_OPTION
 *                             iff formsEnabled OR the draft already uses it
 *
 * That gives a discriminator that works on an instance where NEITHER app is
 * installed: seed one synchronization that already uses the bridge kind and
 * one that does not, and the option must appear on exactly one of them. A
 * broken selector cannot produce that difference.
 *
 * It also makes the target-type rule (REQ-002 / REQ-SYNCUI-008) testable at
 * full strength here: `NEXTCLOUD_FORM_OPTION` is appended to
 * `sourceTypeOptions` only, never to the `typeOptions` the TARGET selector
 * reads. On a sync whose sourceType IS `nextcloud-form`, the source selector
 * must offer it and the target selector must not — in the same DOM, at the
 * same moment.
