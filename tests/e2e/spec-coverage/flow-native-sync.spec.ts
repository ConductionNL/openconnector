 * flow-native-synchronization tasks 2.3 + 2.4 — the DECOMPOSED synchronization,
 * end to end, on real state.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PROVES, AND WHY EACH ASSERTION IS THE ONE IT IS
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * `openconnector.synchronization-run` is a black box. The change replaces it
 * with a drawn pipeline of page-level steps, and
 * `SynchronizationFlowGenerator` renders an existing Synchronization into that
 * pipeline:
 *
 *   trigger-manual
 *     -> openconnector.source-paginate   (one item per PAGE)
 *     -> openregister.explode            (page.results -> one item per record)
 *     -> openconnector.apply-mapping
 *     -> openconnector.contract          (create | update | skip | invalid)
 *     -> openregister.set-fields         (targetUuid, defaulted to "")
 *     -> openregister.object-write       (upsert; skipWhen contract.outcome)
 *     -> openregister.set-fields         (syncedId: written uuid, else contract targetId)
 *     -> openconnector.contract-commit
 *     -> openconnector.contract-sweep
 *     -> openregister.end
 *
 * A spec that asserted "the flow page rendered" would pass against every one
 * of the failure modes this pipeline actually has, so nothing here is a render
 * smoke:
 *
 *   1. the generator's document is preflighted by the live node registry, and
 *      the SAME endpoint is shown refusing a neighbouring mistake in the same
 *      test — a `valid: true` from an endpoint never observed saying `false`
 *      is not evidence;
 *   2. the flow is created, RUN, and the queued run is driven to a terminal
 *      status by executing OpenRegister's FlowRunWorker, after which the
 *      TARGET REGISTER and the CONTRACT TABLE are read back. Both are asserted
 *      to be EMPTY first, so "N rows afterwards" is a measured delta rather
 *      than a coincidence;
 *   3. the flow is run a SECOND time and the target objects are diffed by
 *      identity and by `@self.updated`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `explode` STEP IS LOAD-BEARING and is asserted by type, not by count.
 * `source-paginate` emits one item per PAGE whose json holds the whole
 * `results` list, while every downstream node is per-ITEM. Without the explode
 * the `contract` node finds no single origin id, decides `invalid`, contracts
 * nothing — and `contract-sweep` then sees zero synchronised target ids and
 * treats every existing object as a deletion candidate. Preflight cannot catch
 * that: it validates VOCABULARY, not the SHAPE of the item a node is handed.
 * See openspec/changes/flow-native-synchronization/reference-flow.md.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SOURCE MUST ANSWER WITHOUT A NEXTCLOUD SESSION. The neighbouring
 * `workflows/synchronization-workflow.spec.ts` fixture points a Source at the
 * OpenRegister objects endpoint with no credentials; that returns a session
 * page, not the seeded objects (ocon#1190), so it exercises NC's auth
 * middleware rather than the sync engine. The Source here carries an explicit
 * `Authorization: Basic` header in its `configuration`, which CallService
 * merges into the Guzzle request — verified in-container: the response body
 * carries the seeded run marker. The origin is PROBED through
 * `POST /api/sources/test/{id}` and accepted only when the marker comes back,
 * because the server's own view of itself differs between environments
 * (Apache on :80 inside the dev container, `php -S` on :8080 in CI) and a
 * "first candidate that answers 200" probe would pick the wrong one silently.
 *
 * SPEC ANCHORS. The decomposed pipeline's requirement lives in
 * `openspec/changes/flow-native-synchronization/` and has no capability spec
 * of its own yet, so the `@e2e` anchors below name the EXISTING scenarios this
 * file genuinely covers rather than inventing anchors that resolve to nothing.

/**
 * How to invoke `occ`, resolved once for the whole file.
 *
 * Two environments, two answers, and neither is a default:
 *
 *  - CI checks this repository out INSIDE the Nextcloud server tree
 *    (`server/apps/integriq`) and serves it with `php -S`, so `occ` is a
 *    real file a few directories up and is invoked directly.
 *  - The docker dev container mounts the checkout from OUTSIDE the server
 *    tree, so no `occ` exists above this file and the command has to cross the
 *    container boundary.
 *
 * Both are POSITIVE detections — an `occ` that ANSWERS, or a container that
 * answers `docker inspect`. When neither resolves, the helper THROWS: a spec
 * that quietly skipped its own subject would be an invisible pass.
 *
 * CORRECTION, found by running this spec from the dev checkout: this comment
 * used to say the file EXISTING made a wrong answer "impossible". It does not.
 * `server/occ` exists on this box and its Nextcloud is not installed, so it
 * answers every app command with `There are no commands defined in the
 * "integriq" namespace` — a present instrument wired to nothing, while a
 * working container sat one branch further down and was never reached. An
 * existence check is not a functional check, so candidate 2 now has to prove
 * it can see the app before it is accepted.

	//     contract-hash short-circuit never fired. Fixed by
	//     `contract-commit`'s `targetHashPosition`, which stores
	//     md5(serialize(mapped)) — the legacy recipe, deliberately NOT ksorted,
	//     so a contract written by either engine compares equal.
	//  2. Even once `skip` fired, nothing stopped a skipped item reaching
	//     `object-write`, and `SaveObject::updateObject()` stamps `updated`
	//     unconditionally. Dropping those items was NOT an option: a skipped
	//     item that never reaches the write also never reaches
	//     `contract-sweep`, which deletes whatever its items do not name — so
	//     filtering skips would have DELETED the unchanged objects. Fixed by
	//     `object-write`'s `skipWhen` (pass through, do not drop) plus a
	//     `synced-id` step that gives the sweep an id which survives a skip.
	//
