 * gate-107 reads the manifest and can prove the entries are DECLARED. It
 * cannot prove they RENDER, and this programme has already produced three
 * defects of exactly that shape: an icon name that is not registered renders
 * NO glyph (not a fallback, not a console error — this app shipped three such
 * names), an entry whose `route` names a page the app does not host renders a
 * row that goes nowhere, and `nav.includePersonalSettings: false` silently
 * removed the entry reaching the user's notification preferences.
 *
 * ⚠️ SCOPE EVERY SELECTOR TO `[data-testid="cn-nav"]`. An unscoped selector
 * also matches Nextcloud's own user menu, which is attached-but-hidden:
 * `waitFor({state:'attached'})` passes on it and the click never becomes
 * actionable, so the spec fails with "Target page has been closed" — a timeout
 * wearing a crash's clothes.
 *
 * ⚠️ SETTINGS ENTRIES ARE ATTACHED, NOT VISIBLE, inside a collapsed foldout.
