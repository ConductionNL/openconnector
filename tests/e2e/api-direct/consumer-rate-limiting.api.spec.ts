 * API-direct HTTP-contract assertions for inbound per-consumer rate limiting
 * (consumer-management REQ-CON-RL-002 / RL-003).
 *
 * These are NOT UI-driving Playwright tests — they assert raw HTTP status
 * codes + RateLimit-* response headers against the integriq endpoint
 * gateway. They are excluded from the gate-19 UI run via the `**​/api-direct/**`
 * testIgnore in playwright.config.ts (API-direct → Newman home).
 *
 * LIVE-RUN STATUS: DEFERRED. Exercising the 429 path end-to-end requires a
 * provisioned instance with (a) a `consumer` object carrying
 * `rateLimit {requestsPerWindow, windowSeconds}` and a JWT `authorizationType`
 * with a registered public key, (b) an endpoint with an `authentication` rule
 * bound to that consumer, and (c) a signed JWT for each call. The enforcement
 * logic itself is fully covered by the unit suite
 * (tests/Unit/Service/RateLimit/InboundRateLimitServiceTest.php — 7 cases:
 * under/over limit, headers, quota, atomic admit-exactly-the-limit, distinct
 * keys, unlimited-when-unconfigured). This file documents the observable HTTP
 * contract the enforcement produces and provisions what it can; the JWT-signing
 * prerequisite is why the live assertion is deferred rather than run here.
