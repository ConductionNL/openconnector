 * The single source of truth for the URL prefix an in-app deep link must use.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — and why the obvious probe is wrong
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * `src/main.js` builds the router as
 * `createWebHistory(generateUrl('/apps/integriq'))`. Since the switch to
 * PATH-based history, a deep link is only honoured when its prefix is BYTE-FOR
 * -BYTE the value `generateUrl()` returned in that browser:
 *
 *   - apache dev container (mod_rewrite on)  → `/apps/integriq`
 *   - CI's `php -S` install (no rewrite)     → `/index.php/apps/integriq`
 *
 * A URL under the other prefix sits OUTSIDE the router base, matches no route,
 * hits the `'/:pathMatch(.*)*'` catch-all and is redirected to `/` — the
 * DASHBOARD. Nothing throws, nothing 404s, no console error is emitted.
 *
 * Six spec files each kept a private copy of this probe:
 *
 *     for (const candidate of ['/apps/integriq', '/index.php/apps/integriq'])
 *         if (res.ok() && (await res.text()).includes('integriq-main.js'))
 *             return candidate
 *
 * 🔴 That probe CANNOT WORK, and it fails towards green. Nextcloud serves the
 * identical SPA shell under BOTH prefixes — same 200, same
 * `integriq-main.js` — so the loop always stops at the first candidate,
 * `/apps/integriq`, which is the one CI's router will not honour. Every
 * caller then loaded the Dashboard while believing it was on the page it named.
 * Measured in run 31929156734: the browser sat at
 * `http://localhost:8080/apps/integriq/sources` while the app's own XHRs
 * went to `/index.php/apps/...`, i.e. `generateUrl()` had returned the OTHER
 * prefix. Specs asserting "something rendered" passed against the Dashboard;
 * specs asserting a real selector failed with a misleading message.
 *
 * THE FIX: ask the app. `OC.generateUrl()` is the very function `src/main.js`
 * calls, evaluated in the same browser, so the answer cannot disagree with the
 * router base. It is a resolution, not a guess — there is no candidate list
 * left to get in the wrong order.
