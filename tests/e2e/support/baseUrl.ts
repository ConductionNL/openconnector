 * The single source of truth for which Nextcloud the e2e suite talks to.
 *
 * Every spec, helper and the Playwright config itself must resolve the target
 * instance through this module. Two rules, both learned the hard way:
 *
 *  1. There is NO hardcoded default. The config used to read
 *     `process.env.NEXTCLOUD_URL || 'http://localhost:8080'` and several specs
 *     hardcoded `http://localhost:8080` outright — that is the *shared* dev
 *     container. A suite that silently falls back to it creates fixtures in
 *     other people's environment and reports measurements taken somewhere
 *     nobody intended. Failing loudly on an unset variable is strictly better
 *     than defaulting to someone else's instance.
 *
 *     `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` wins when set, but `BASE_URL` is accepted too:
 *     that is the name the shared `ConductionNL/.github` quality workflow
 *     exports. An earlier revision of this module read `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`
 *     *only*, and integriq's "E2E Tests (Playwright)" job hard-failed on
 *     every CI run since with `Error: PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL is not set.` —
 *     locally correct, and dead everywhere it mattered. Strict about never
 *     inventing a target; permissive about which variable names it.
 *
 *     `NEXTCLOUD_URL` and `NC_BASE_URL` are accepted for the same reason.
 *     The shared quality workflow's "Run Playwright tests" step exports all
 *     three of BASE_URL / NEXTCLOUD_URL / NC_BASE_URL (verified in
 *     `ConductionNL/.github/.github/workflows/quality.yml`), and 15 of the 21
 *     fleet repos resolve their target as `process.env.NEXTCLOUD_URL || ...`.
 *     Accepting every name the fleet uses costs nothing; the thing that must
 *     stay gone is the literal fallback, not the alternate spellings.
 *
 *  2. Absolute and relative navigation must not be able to disagree. Specs that
 *     build their own `http://host:port/...` strings drifted away from
 *     `use.baseURL` the moment either changed. `absoluteUrl()` derives those
 *     strings from the same value Playwright navigates with, so there is only
 *     one thing to get right.
