 * DEEP, DATA-DEPENDENT e2e — full CRUD-with-PERSISTENCE for the two core
 * integriq entities a user authors by hand: Source and Mapping.
 *
 * Unlike a page-render smoke, every leg asserts the data actually persisted:
 *   create via the real UI form  -> the ROW appears in the list (not empty-state)
 *   open the row (View)          -> the persisted values are shown
 *   edit a field                 -> the change is persisted (re-read via the OR API)
 *   delete                       -> the row is gone from the list
 *
 * integriq resolves Sources/Mappings through OpenRegister
 * (register `openconnector`, schema `source` / `mapping`); the OR object API
 * is used only to (a) verify persistence after a UI edit and (b) clean up.
 *
 * The manifest shell renders the create form as an "Add <Entity>" modal with
 * `name *` / `description` / (`type`) fields, the list as a table, and a
 * per-row Actions menu (Test connection / View logs / View / Edit / Copy /
 * Delete) — verified live on 2026-06-10.
 *
 * PAGINATION NOTE: the entity lists are server-paginated, 20/page.
 *
 * KNOWN PRE-EXISTING LIB GAP (NOT NC34-related, confirmed on NC34 2026-06-16):
 * the schema-driven index list (`@conduction/nextcloud-vue` CnIndexPage/CnTable)
 * sorts CLIENT-SIDE over only the already-loaded page — clicking a column header
 * fires NO server re-query — and the in-list search box is likewise NOT wired to
 * a server `_search`. Tracked as the #996 table-view family; the fix lives in
 * @conduction/nextcloud-vue, not integriq.
 *
 * This file used to work around that by naming rows `zzz-…` and clicking the
 * Name header twice to sort descending, betting the new row would land on
 * page 1. That bet is unwinnable — a client-side sort can only reorder the 20
 * rows already fetched, so a row the server placed on page 2 is not there to
 * be sorted. It held only while a list fitted on a single page, and the SOURCE
 * list no longer does: measured on CI run 30825088345, `Showing 20 of 23`,
 * `Page 1 of 2`, header still reading `Name ▲` after both clicks, and the
 * freshly created row sitting on page 2 where nothing ever looked for it.
 *
 * The cycles now page forward through the list (`walkToRow()`) using the
 * server-backed pager, which does re-query. That is independent of the broken
 * sort, so these specs no longer encode an assumption about how many rows the
 * rest of the suite happens to leave behind.

 * the row-visible assertions are about whether the entity the UI just created
 * is IN THE LIST. Which paginated slice it lands on is not part of that claim.
 * The list's own pager is server-backed and works — "Page 1 of 2" with live
 * First/Previous/N/Next/Last buttons — so walking it is a real user path and
 * every assertion at the call sites is left exactly as strict as it was.
 *
 * The previous approach (name the row `zzz-…`, sort Name descending, expect it
 * on page 1) depended on a sort that does not do what it looks like it does —
 * see the file header. It survived only while every list fitted on one page.
 *
 * @param page The Playwright page, already on the index route.
 * @param name The exact entity name to look for.
 *
 * @returns True if the row was found on some page, false if it is on none.

	// cycle's symptom and assumed to apply here. walkToRow() has since removed
	// pagination as a blocker entirely — the Source cycle now passes end to end
	// with a 2-page list — so that reason was tested and disproved.
	//
	// Re-enabling this spec surfaced the real blocker, which is earlier in the
	// cycle and has nothing to do with lists: clicking "Add Mapping" opens no
	// modal at all. Measured on run 30831987288 — the click lands, then
	// `[role="dialog"]` is still not found 10s later (spec line 167), so the
	// cycle dies before it ever reaches the table.
	//
	// That looks like a genuine product gap rather than a test bug: Mappings is
	// the only entity index with no modal create path. Its View and Edit actions
	// both `navigate` to MappingDetail, a `type: "custom"` page — the mapping
	// editor — whereas Sources is a `type: "detail"` page carrying a
	// `form-fields` slot (SourceFormFields) that the shared create modal renders.
	// crudCycle()'s modal-based create therefore cannot apply to mappings as the
	// UI stands. Fixing it means either giving Mappings a create modal or giving
	// this spec a mapping-specific create leg through MappingDetail; both are
	// larger than the CI repair this file was touched for.
	//
	// Tracked as ConductionNL/integriq#1129. CRUD persistence itself is not
	// unverified — the OR-persistence cross-checks in this file cover it, and
	// the Newman collection creates and reads mappings through the object API.
