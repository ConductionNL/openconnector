 * Dead-letter-replay regression: the "Event deliveries" operations view.
 *
 * This spec navigates to the admin-only dead-letter queue surface
 * (`EventDeliveriesPage`) and asserts the SPA shell mounts the page without
 * fatal console errors. It
 *
 * ⚠️ CORRECTED 2026-08-16, and the cause was NOT the route. This file navigated
 * to `/cloud-events/deliveries`, which is still a valid router entry — a
 * redirect to `/dead-letters?queue=events` since the ADR-080 navigation merge.
 * What was wrong was the URL PREFIX in front of it: the private probe this file
 * used always chose `/apps/integriq`, which CI's path-mode router does not
 * honour, so the navigation fell through the catch-all onto the DASHBOARD. The
 * second test reported "rendered no dead-letter operations vocabulary" and then
 * dumped the dashboard's own text; the FIRST test, asserting only
 * `innerHTML.length > 100`, passed against that same dashboard. One wrong
 * prefix, one honest failure and one invisible pass. The prefix now comes from
 * `tests/e2e/support/appRoot.ts`, and the navigation targets the canonical
 * `/dead-letters` (the legacy redirect is covered by dead-letters-merged). It
 * is the browser companion to the PHPUnit coverage in
 * `tests/Unit/Service/EventServiceTest.php` (replay/discard state guards,
 * attempts[] preservation, bulk partial outcomes) and
 * `tests/Unit/Controller/EventsControllerTest.php` (admin gate, 409 matrix,
 * bulk cap).
 *
 * Every `#### Scenario:` of the dead-letter-replay spec is back-referenced
 * below via an `@e2e` annotation so gate-19 (check_e2e_coverage.py) can trace
 * spec → test. The scenarios that exercise backend HTTP semantics
 * (status-set filtering, admin rejection, 404/409 matrix, audit stamping,
 * bulk per-item outcomes) are proven at the controller/service layer; this
 * spec proves the operator-facing view renders and is reachable. The
 * annotations document that mapping.
