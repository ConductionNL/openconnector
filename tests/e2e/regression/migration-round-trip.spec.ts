 * Chain E regression: migration round-trip.
 *
 * Spec: openconnector-comprehensive-tests (openspec/specs/ dir name, unrenamed)
 *   "Playwright MUST include a migration round-trip spec" — install with legacy
 *   data present → run the chain-B storage migration → all resource pages still
 *   show the same data counts as before migration.
 *
 * On the dev/CI container the chain-B migration runs automatically as a repair
 * step (lib/Migration/Version2Date20260520000001.php) during `occ upgrade` /
 * app enable — it sets `integriq.storage_migrated = 'true'` on a clean run.
 * There is currently NO standalone `occ integriq:migrate-storage` console
 * command registered in this repo (the migration is invoked from the repair
 * step, not a Command class) — see the migrator's own log message which still
 * references that command as a future per-entity retry hook. This spec therefore
 * verifies the *post-migration round-trip invariant* that the spec's acceptance
 * scenarios assert against ("the Sources list page shows the same data", "all 10
 * resource pages show no error/empty-state unexpectedly"):
 *
 *   1. The migration completed (`storage_migrated === 'true'`).
 *   2. Every migrated schema is queryable via OR's generic CRUD route with a
 *      200 + array body — no page regresses to an error state after migration.
 *   3. Counts are STABLE across two consecutive reads — the migration is a
 *      one-shot that does not duplicate or drop rows on re-read (the round-trip
 *      invariant; a non-idempotent migration would diverge here).
 *
 * If `storage_migrated` is not `'true'` on the target instance, the
 * round-trip assertions are skipped (matching or-cutover-smoke.spec.ts and
 * synced-from-leaf.spec.ts) rather than producing a false failure.

 * Read `integriq.storage_migrated`.
 *
 * ⚠️ This used to probe `GET /index.php/apps/integriq/api/settings` and
 * fall back to `false` "when the endpoint is unavailable so the test skips
 * cleanly". That route DOES NOT EXIST in this repo — appinfo/routes.php
 * records it as deliberately deleted ("GET /api/settings + PUT /api/settings —
 * replaced by OR's /api/settings/* surface"); the only surviving settings
 * route is `POST /api/settings/rebase`. So the probe 404'd on every run, the
 * fallback turned that into `false`, and all three specs below reported
 * "skipped" for a reason with nothing to do with the migration. Measured
 * against the dev container: `GET .../api/settings` → 404, while the flag
 * itself was `true`. A guard that cannot observe its own precondition is
 * indistinguishable from a suite that passes.
 *
 * Read the flag itself instead, via Nextcloud core's provisioning API — a
 * shipped, always-enabled app, and the authoritative store for an app-config
 * value.
 *
 * ⚠️ An OCS HTTP 200 is the status of the ENVELOPE, not of the call. The real
 * result is `ocs.meta.statuscode`, which is checked separately below.
 *
 * The measured values are logged unconditionally: when this returns false the
 * three specs skip, and a skip whose cause is not written down is exactly the
 * failure mode this function already had once.
