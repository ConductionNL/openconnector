 * E2E: the "Synced from" integration leaf surfaces a synchronization
 * contract on the OpenRegister object it syncs.
 *
 * This is the cross-app provenance promise of the integration registry:
 * Integriq registers a Path-2 leaf (SynchronizationContractProvider)
 * with OpenRegister; any app that renders an OR object's integration
 * surface (OpenCatalogi publication detail, OpenRegister object detail,
 * decidesk, …) then shows "Synced from" with the contract — with no code
 * change in the consuming app.
 *
 * The test seeds a target object + a synchronization + a contract whose
 * `targetId` is that object, then asserts:
 *   1. The leaf endpoint (the data every registry surface consumes)
 *      returns the contract, rendered (title/subtitle/url/originId).
 *   2. The leaf matches strictly by targetId (a different object is empty).
 *   3. The leaf renders the contract row in a real object-detail UI
 *      (OpenRegister's object detail → Integrations → "Synced from").
 *
 * Regression guard for the two bugs fixed alongside this spec:
 *   - findAll filter shape (register/schema leaking as property filters →
 *     always empty);
 *   - getUuid() via Entity __call (method_exists false → HTTP 500).
 *
 * The provider gates on `integriq.storage_migrated === 'true'`; the
 * suite skips (not fails) when that flag isn't set on the instance.

// 'publication'"}` and took the whole describe down with it.
//
// Nothing in what this spec asserts needs a publication.
// `SynchronizationContractProvider::list()` matches on `targetId === $objectId`
