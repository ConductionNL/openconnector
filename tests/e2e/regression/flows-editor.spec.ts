 * Flows surface regression — the ADR-096 index page and the consolidated
 * flow editor, as this app renders them.
 *
 * Two defects this spec pins down, both found live on 2026-08-18:
 *
 *   - `/flows` was the one page in the app that looked like a different
 *     product: the deprecated `CnFlowIndexPage` bare table, with none of
 *     `CnIndexPage`'s chrome. It is now an ordinary index page, and the
 *     "New flow" button renders — `CnIndexPage`'s `#header-actions` slot
 *     was documented from the start and wired to nothing, so the button
 *     shipped into the void while the page looked fine.
 *
 *   - "New flow" rendered an empty-state note instead of the editor. It now
 *     renders the SAME builder as an existing flow, holding only the seeded
 *     manual-trigger start node, with the toolbar on the canvas.
 *
 * @spec openspec/specs/flow-orchestration/spec.md#REQ-017

/**
 * Reveal a flow action, opening the sidebar's Actions menu when it is closed.
 *
 * `CnFlowSidebar` hands `flowActions` to NcAppSidebar's `#secondary-actions`
 * slot, which renders each as an `NcActionButton` inside an `NcActions` MENU.
 * The items are not in the DOM until the menu is opened, so a direct click on
 * one waits out its whole budget and reads as a missing control.
 *
 * The trigger's accessible name has moved more than once, so several are tried
 * and the failure names every one attempted rather than reporting the last.
 *
 * @param {Page} page The page.
 * @param {Locator} item The action to reveal.
 * @return {Promise<void>} Resolves once the item is visible.
