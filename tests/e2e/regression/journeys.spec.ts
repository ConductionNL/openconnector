 * Chain E regression: end-to-end user journeys (UI-driven).

 * Counterpart to the Newman API suite (folder 13 of
 * `tests/postman/integriq.postman_collection.json`). Where Newman
 * exercises the HTTP surface, this spec drives the integriq Vue
 * frontend — the nc-vue manifest-renderer (`CnIndexPage` /
 * `CnFormDialog`) — so a visual click-through is what creates the
 * objects. The dialog's Save handler posts to OR's
 * `/api/objects/integriq/{schema}/*` under the hood, so a green
 * run guarantees the full UI → nc-vue → OR backend → list-refresh loop
 * is intact.
 *
 *   J1  Source        — `/sources` index → Add → fill name → Create.
 *   J2  Mapping       — `/mappings` index → Add → fill name → Create.
 *   J3  Synchronization — `/synchronizations` index → Add → fill name → Create.
 *   J4  Endpoint      — `/endpoints` index → Add → fill name → Create.
 *
 * Each journey:
 *   1. Navigates to the section's deep-link route.
 *   2. Clicks the primary "Add {schema}" button on `CnActionsBar`.
 *   3. Fills the name field in the schema-driven `CnFormDialog`.
 *   4. Clicks the primary "Create" button.
 *   5. Waits for the OR `POST` to come back 200/201.
 *   6. Asserts the newly-created row text appears in the index table.
 *   7. Cleans up by clicking through the UI: tick the row checkbox →
 *      Actions menu → "Delete selected" → confirm in CnMassDeleteDialog.
 *      Both create AND delete go through nc-vue's components against the

/*
 * UI journeys J1–J4 — full UI-driven create+delete loop, end-to-end

 *
 * What's exercised: page.goto(/sources, /mappings, …) → CnIndexPage
 * mounts (self-fetch via the register+schema in `config`) → click
 * "Add {Title}" → CnFormDialog opens → fill `name` → click Create →
 * the dialog's `$emit('confirm')` arrives at CnIndexPage.onFormConfirm
 * which calls `selfObjectStore.saveObject(selfObjectType, formData)`
 * — that POSTs to `/api/objects/integriq/{schema}` on OR and
 * triggers a `list.refresh()` on success → assert the new row appears
 * → tick its checkbox → CnActionsBar Actions menu → "Delete selected"
 * → CnMassDeleteDialog confirm → DELETE round-trip + list.refresh().
 *
 * The self-fetch save/delete wiring was added to nc-vue's CnIndexPage
 * after beta.65 (hoist `selfObjectStore` + `selfObjectType` out of
 * setup's `if (isSelfFetch)` block, then route onFormConfirm /
 * onMassDeleteConfirm / onSingleDeleteConfirm through them when no
 * explicit `store` prop is given). Without that change the click was
 * a silent no-op (no POST fired, dialog stayed open) because
 * CnPageRenderer forwards props but not event listeners.
