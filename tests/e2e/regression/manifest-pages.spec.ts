 * Chain E regression: manifest-driven page smoke test.
 *
 * Most integriq pages render via nc-vue's built-in `CnIndexPage` /
 * `CnDetailPage` / `CnLogsPage` / `CnDashboardPage`, with their CRUD wired
 * against OR's `/api/objects/integriq/{schema}/*` routes. Ten pages are
 * `type: custom` and render a bespoke component named by the manifest.
 *
 * This spec navigates to EVERY manifest page route and asserts:
 *   - the SPA shell mounts (`#app-content` is present)
 *   - no console errors fire during initial mount
 *   - the rendered page contains either a list/grid/header (data path)
 *     or an empty-state message (cold-start path) — either is acceptable
 *
 * Read-only: these tests do NOT create / mutate data; they validate the
 * pages LOAD against a running container. Per-page CRUD flows live in
 * separate specs (sources-crud.spec.ts, etc.).
 *
 * WHY THE PAGE TABLE IS WRITTEN OUT AND THEN GUARDED
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * `MANIFEST_PAGES` used to be a hand-maintained list with a comment claiming
 * it held "24 manifest pages". The manifest has since grown to 35 and nothing
 * compared the two, so ten pages — every `type: custom` screen added after the
 * list was written, plus `Flows` and `Traces` — were never navigated to by any
 * test. The list had also gone stale in the other direction: it still drove
 * `/import`, a route the manifest no longer declares, and passed, because the
 * router silently lands an unknown hash on the dashboard and the dashboard
 * mounts fine. A stale table does not fail; it quietly tests the wrong page.
 *
 * The table is still literal, because the component names have to be readable
 * here (both for a human debugging a failure and for gate-26 visual-coverage,
 * which asks whether any e2e test drives a given page component). What is new
 * is `manifest page table is complete and current` below: it reads
 * `src/manifest.json` and asserts the table matches it exactly — id, route,
 * type and component. Add a page to the manifest without adding it here and
 * that test fails naming the page.
 *
 * Cross-ref:
 * - openspec/specs/openconnector-frontend-vue-rewrite/spec.md
 * - src/manifest.json

/*
 * SCENARIOS THIS FILE PROVES.
 *
 * Each tag below was checked by reading the scenario's GIVEN/WHEN/THEN in the
 * spec and the assertion in this file side by side; a tag is here only when the
 * assertions establish the scenario's THEN, not merely touch its subject. The
 * page-mount tags cover the loop at `manifest pages — schema-driven render`,
 * which drives every manifest route and asserts the shell mounted, that content
 * rendered inside `#app-content`, and that no console errors fired.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * BEFORE YOU ADD AN @e2e TAG: VERIFY THE TEST BODY, NOT A GREP.
 *
 * There is a real technique here — a scenario whose coverage already exists but
 * is recorded as an `@e2e exclude` instead of an anchor should be anchored, and
 * that costs no new tests. There is also a way to get it exactly wrong, and the
 * two look identical from the command line.
 *
 * `grep -rl <capability> tests/e2e/` HITTING IS NOT EVIDENCE. A sibling app
 * applied this technique to a waiver that looked just like the ones below —
 * reason naming a future action, change archived weeks ago, grep hit present —
 * and the hit turned out to be an explanatory COMMENT inside a test about
 * something else. The two waived scenarios had no relevant assertion anywhere.
 * Anchoring there would have closed a coverage finding by annotating untested
 * code: the precise defect this gate exists to catch, reproduced by hand.
 *
 * The rule: open the test, read its assertions, and satisfy yourself that they
 * establish the scenario's THEN. If they only touch the subject, or assert
 * something weaker, leave the finding visible and say why — see the
 * "NOT tagged here, deliberately" list below, which exists for exactly that.
 *
 * The same rule applies in the other direction when auditing an existing
 * `@e2e exclude`. Reasons that name a path or a `Class::method` are usually
 * true; pathless ones ("verified by PHPUnit") usually are not, and correcting
 * them makes the uncovered count RISE. That is the honest outcome, not a
 * regression — a waiver whose promised test never arrived was hiding the gap,
 * not filling it.

// In Nextcloud installs with `htaccess.RewriteBase => '/'` (the
// default for the apache-served dev container) `generateUrl` returns
// `/apps/integriq` and the Vue Router's `base` is set to that —
// any URL prefixed with `/index.php/` then sits outside the router
// base, so no route matches and the page renders empty. In CI's php -S
// install (no htaccess processing) the inverse is true and only the
// `/index.php/...` form works. Resolve at runtime via a HEAD probe.
// 🔴 The candidate-probe that used to live here could not answer that
// question. Nextcloud serves the IDENTICAL SPA shell under both prefixes, so
// `res.ok() && body.includes('integriq-main.js')` is true for the first
// candidate every time — and on CI that is the prefix the router does NOT
// honour. Every one of the 36 mount tests below therefore navigated to a URL
// outside the router base, fell through the `'/:pathMatch(.*)*'` catch-all,
// landed on the DASHBOARD, and then passed: they asserted only
// "innerHTML.length > 100 and no console errors", which the dashboard
// satisfies. 36 green tests photographing one page.
//
// Resolution now comes from `OC.generateUrl` — the function src/main.js itself
