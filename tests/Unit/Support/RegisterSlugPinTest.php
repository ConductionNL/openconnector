/**
 * The case that has never once been caught.
 *
 * A consumer pinned to a superseded register slug on a MIGRATED instance does
 * not raise. `openregister_registers` holds no row with that slug, so the read
 * matches nothing and returns an empty result set, which is byte-for-byte what a
 * healthy but empty register returns. There is no exception, no 404, no log line
 * separating the two. Every other guard in this repository watches behaviour,
 * and this defect has no behaviour to watch: it is a feature that quietly stops
 * happening.
 *
 * So the guard is static, and repo-wide rather than diff-scoped. Diff scope is
 * right for debt a PR could reasonably be asked to carry. It is wrong here,
 * because every one of these references was written BEFORE the rename and will
 * therefore never appear in a diff again. A diff-scoped version of this test
 * passes on a repository full of the defect.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT catch
 *
 * It reads lines, not data flow. A superseded slug arriving from app config,
 * from a manifest, or through more than one assignment is invisible to it, as is
 * a `match` arm built at run time. That is why
 * {@see \OCA\Integriq\Tests\Unit\Controller\MappingsControllerRegisterResolutionTest}
 * sits beside it: this guard stops the literal being TYPED, and that one stops
 * the resolved slug being IGNORED.

	 * this app is: the fleet's service bus. It already writes into registers it
	 * does not own — `zaken`, `documenten` and `vng-gemma` all appear in
	 * register position under lib/ — so it is the app most likely to be the one

	 * never a register slug on any instance.
