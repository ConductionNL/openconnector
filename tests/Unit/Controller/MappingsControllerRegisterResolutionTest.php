/**
 * Migrated and unmigrated instances, told apart.
 *
 * ## Why the migrated case is the only one that catches this
 *
 * Reinstating the pinned literal reddens the migrated-instance test below and
 * the static guard in {@see \OCA\Integriq\Tests\Unit\Support\RegisterSlugPinTest}.
 * It does NOT redden the unmigrated-instance test, because on an unmigrated
 * instance the pinned literal happens to be the right answer. That is why this
 * defect survived: every test anyone had written was, in effect, the unmigrated
 * case, and the one existing test of this endpoint
 * ({@see MappingsControllerSaveObjectTest}) names a register explicitly and so
 * never reaches the default at all.
 *
 * Watched failing, not assumed. With `register: $register` reverted to
 * `register: ($data['register'] ?? 'openconnector')` and the resolution branch
 * removed, four of ten tests reddened and they were the right four. The exact
 * measurement is recorded in
 * {@see testAMigratedInstanceIsWrittenWithItsCurrentSlug}.
 *
 * ## Why the write is refused rather than defaulted
 *
 * The absence has to be visible. Before the resolution this path wrote into
 * `openconnector` regardless, and OpenRegister answers a write to a register
 * that is not there without raising, so the endpoint returned 200 carrying an
 * object nobody could read back. An empty success and a real success are the
 * same response.

	 * 🔴 THE ONE THAT CATCHES IT. Mutation measured before this file was
	 * committed, by deleting the resolution branch and putting
	 * `register: ($data['register'] ?? 'openconnector')` back. Ten tests ran,
	 * four reddened and they were the right four:
	 *
	 *  - this test: expected 'integriq', got 'openconnector';
	 *  - `testAnInstanceWithoutTheRegisterRefusesTheWrite`: 1 write where 0 were
	 *    allowed, and a 200 where the caller needed a 409;
	 *  - `testAnUnavailableResolverRefusesTheWrite`: same, by the same route;
	 *  - `RegisterSlugPinTest::testNoSourceFilePinsASupersededRegisterSlug`,
	 *    naming `lib/Controller/MappingsController.php:338`, the superseded slug
	 *    and the canonical one. Line 338 was checked against the mutated file
	 *    and is the pinned line itself, which is what
	 *    `FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES` buys over `FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES`.
	 *
	 * Six stayed GREEN under that same mutation, and two of those matter:
	 * `testAnUnmigratedInstanceIsWrittenWithItsOldSlug`, because on an
	 * unmigrated instance the pinned literal happens to be right, and
	 * `MappingsControllerSaveObjectTest`, which is the whole of what this
	 * endpoint had before and names its register explicitly.
