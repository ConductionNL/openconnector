# Synchronizations

Synchronizations are processes that transfer data between different sources (from source A to source B). During this transfer, the data can be transformed and enriched through:

- Conditional logic and filtering
- Data mapping and transformations (mapping, flattening, etc.)
- Business rules and validations
- Additional actions and triggers

This allows for flexible and powerful data integration scenarios while maintaining data consistency across systems.
