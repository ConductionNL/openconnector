# Setting Up Mappings

Mappings define how data from your sources is transformed and mapped to your target systems.

## Understanding Mappings

A mapping consists of:
- Source fields
- Target fields
- Transformation rules
- Validation rules

## Creating a New Mapping

1. Go to the Mappings section
2. Click "Create New Mapping"
3. Select source and target
4. Define field mappings

## Mapping Types

### Direct Mapping
- One-to-one field mapping
- No transformation needed
- Direct data transfer

### Transformation Mapping
- Data type conversion
- Format changes
- Complex transformations

### Conditional Mapping
- Based on rules
- If-then logic
- Data filtering

## Field Mapping Options

### Basic Operations
- Field renaming
- Type conversion
- Format adjustment

### Advanced Operations
- Concatenation
- Splitting
- Mathematical operations
- Custom functions

## Validation Rules

Set up validation to ensure data quality:
- Required fields
- Data type validation
- Range checks
- Custom validation rules

## Testing Your Mapping

Before implementing:
1. Use the mapping tester
2. Review sample data
3. Verify transformations
4. Check error handling

## Best Practices

- Document your mappings
- Use clear naming conventions
- Test with various data scenarios
- Monitor mapping performance

## Next Steps

After setting up your mappings:
- [Configure synchronization jobs](jobs)
- Set up error handling
- Monitor data flow
