# Creating Synchronization Jobs

Jobs automate the process of data synchronization between your sources and targets.

## Understanding Jobs

A job defines:
- When to run (schedule)
- What to synchronize (data selection)
- How to transform (mapping)
- Where to send (target)

## Creating a New Job

1. Navigate to Jobs section
2. Click "Create New Job"
3. Configure job settings
4. Set up schedule
5. Select source and mapping
6. Define target

## Job Types

### Scheduled Jobs
- Run at specific times
- Periodic execution
- Calendar-based scheduling

### Event-Triggered Jobs
- Run on specific events
- Real-time synchronization
- Conditional execution

### Manual Jobs
- Run on-demand
- Testing purposes
- One-time synchronization

## Job Configuration

### Schedule Settings
- Frequency
- Start time
- End time
- Time zone
- Retry settings

### Data Selection
- Full sync
- Incremental sync
- Filter criteria
- Batch size

### Error Handling
- Retry attempts
- Error notifications
- Fallback actions
- Logging level

## Monitoring and Management

### Job Status
- Active/Inactive
- Last run status
- Next scheduled run
- Success/failure rate

### Performance Metrics
- Execution time
- Data volume
- Error rate
- Resource usage

## Best Practices

- Start with test jobs
- Monitor performance
- Set up notifications
- Regular maintenance
- Document configurations

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Schedule conflicts
- Resource constraints
- Network issues
- Data validation errors

## Next Steps

After setting up jobs:
- Monitor job execution
- Review logs
- Optimize performance
- Set up alerts
