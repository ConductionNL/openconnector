## Why Nextcloud?

We chose Nextcloud as our platform for several compelling reasons:

### Seamless Integration with Enterprise Systems
Nextcloud provides robust integration capabilities with Microsoft Office 365 and SharePoint, allowing organizations to maintain their existing workflows while adding powerful document processing capabilities. Users can seamlessly access and process documents across platforms without disrupting their established processes.

### Enterprise-Grade Security
By leveraging Nextcloud's secure infrastructure, DocuDesk ensures all document processing happens within your controlled environment. This means sensitive data never leaves your premises while still enabling collaborative features and integrations with external systems.

### Easy Installation and Updates
DocuDesk is available directly through the Nextcloud App Store, making installation as simple as a few clicks:

1. Log in to your Nextcloud instance as an administrator
2. Navigate to the Apps section
3. Find DocuDesk in the Office & Text category
4. Click "Install"

Note: For anonymization functionality, you'll need to provide your own LLM (Language Learning Model) tool. We recommend using Presidio, an open-source solution. You can find detailed installation instructions for Presidio at https://github.com/MWest2020/presidio-nl/tree/main/docs. However, you're free to use other anonymization tools that suit your needs.

The app will automatically stay up-to-date with your Nextcloud instance, ensuring you always have the latest features and security updates.

### Scalability and Performance
Nextcloud's architecture allows DocuDesk to handle everything from individual document processing to large-scale batch operations, all while maintaining optimal performance within your local environment.
