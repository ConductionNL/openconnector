## App Structure
- Root Directory:
  - `appinfo/` - Nextcloud app configuration
  - `tests/` - Test files
  - `composer.json` - PHP dependencies
  - `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
  - `phpunit.xml` - PHPUnit configuration
  - `phpcs.xml` - PHP CodeSniffer configuration
  - `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
  - `webpack.config.js` - Webpack configuration

## Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commits
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Update documentation in same commit as code changes

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code
- Include comments for complex logic
- Follow language-specific best practices

## Feature Development Workflow

### 1. User Story Creation
- When a new feature is requested, first create a user story:
  - Format: "As a {role} I want {change} because {reason}"
  - Include acceptance criteria:
    - Functional requirements
    - Technical requirements
    - Performance requirements
    - Security requirements
    - Documentation requirements
  - Required additional information:
    - User roles involved
    - Current workflow/process
    - Expected outcome
    - Integration points
    - Security considerations
    - Performance expectations
    - Data requirements
    - UI/UX requirements
    - Testing requirements
    - Documentation needs
  - Present user story to stakeholder for validation

### 2. Analysis Phase
- Read and analyze existing codebase:
  - Review all relevant PHP code in lib/
  - Review all relevant Vue code in src/
  - Identify affected components
  - Identify required changes
  - Document dependencies
  - Note potential impacts

### 3. Implementation Planning
Create detailed implementation plan including:
- Backend changes:
  - New/modified PHP classes
  - Database changes
  - API endpoints
  - Service modifications
  - Security considerations
- Frontend changes:
  - Component updates
  - State management
  - API integration
  - UI/UX implementation
- Test coverage:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests
- Documentation updates:
  - Technical documentation
  - User documentation
  - API documentation
  - Architecture updates
- Present plan to stakeholder for approval

### 4. Implementation Phase
Only proceed after stakeholder approval:
1. Create/update backend components
2. Create/update frontend components
3. Add/update tests
4. Update documentation
5. Quality checks:
   - Run PHP CodeSniffer
   - Run PHPStan
   - Run ESLint
   - Run TypeScript checks
   - Run unit tests
   - Fix any issues
   - Repeat until all checks pass

### 5. Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant documentation in website/docs:
  - Technical documentation
  - User documentation
  - API documentation if applicable
  - Update diagrams
  - Add code examples
  - Document configuration
  - Document dependencies

### 6. Quality Assurance
- Automated checks:
  - PHP CodeSniffer compliance
  - PHPStan level 8 compliance
  - Psalm compliance
  - ESLint compliance
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Unit test coverage
  - Integration test coverage
- Manual checks:
  - Code review guidelines
  - Security review
  - Performance testing
  - Accessibility testing

### 7. Version Control
- Commit messages must:
  - Reference user story
  - Describe changes clearly
  - Include documentation updates
  - Note breaking changes
  - Include test coverage

### 8. Special Considerations
- Never use backticks (`) in documentation or code edits
- Always use single quotes (') for code examples
- Always run quality checks before requesting review
- Fix all linter and test issues before completion
- Document all decisions and assumptions
- Keep stakeholder informed of progress
- Update project documentation as needed
