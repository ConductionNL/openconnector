## üöÄ Version
**Current Version:** 1.40 - Fixed Autoload Generation Inside Container + Timeout Protection  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** üîÑ Testing In Progress  
**Approach:** Use app:install as primary method + force migration execution by disable/enable + enhanced database verification with proper MariaDB container connection + fixed autoload generation inside container + timeout protection for hanging commands

## üéØ Strategy
Run unit tests inside a real Nextcloud Docker container with comprehensive diagnostics and host-based autoloader generation to ensure proper class loading and test execution.

## üê≥ Docker Stack
- **MariaDB 10.6** - Database (matching local setup)
- **Redis 7** - Caching and sessions
- **MailHog** - Email testing (`ghcr.io/juliusknorr/nextcloud-dev-mailhog:latest`)
- **Nextcloud** - Real environment (`nextcloud:31`) - Updated from `ghcr.io/juliusknorr/nextcloud-dev-php81:latest` for compatibility

## üîß Key Features
1. **Fixed Autoload Generation** - Generate autoload files inside container instead of host to fix lib/autoload.php not found error (v1.40)
2. **Timeout Protection** - Added timeouts to prevent hanging progress bars and command timeouts (v1.40)
3. **Enhanced Database Verification** - Use proper MariaDB container connection for database table verification with comprehensive diagnostics (v1.39)
4. **App Install Primary Method** - Use app:install as primary method to ensure database migrations run properly (v1.38)
3. **Forced Migration Execution** - Force app migration execution by disable/enable cycle to ensure tables are created (v1.38)
4. **Proper Database Migration Commands** - Use valid Nextcloud commands (db:add-missing-indices, db:add-missing-columns, db:convert-filecache-bigint) instead of non-existent app:upgrade (v1.38)
5. **Resilient Health Checks** - Fixed overly strict health checks with warnings instead of immediate exits (v1.37)
6. **Command Timeout Protection** - 30-second timeouts prevent hanging occ commands (v1.36)
7. **Comprehensive Diagnostics** - Enhanced error reporting with container status, log analysis, and pre-class loading diagnostics (v1.36)
8. **Available Commands Testing** - Tests only commands that actually exist in the Nextcloud environment (v1.35)
9. **Database Schema Preparation** - `maintenance:repair` before app:enable ensures database tables are ready (v1.34)
10. **Composer Installation Order** - Composer installed before app dependencies in both jobs, with proper step ordering (v1.33)
11. **Clear Step Names** - All step names specify execution context (GitHub Actions runner vs Nextcloud container) (v1.31)
12. **Workflow Consistency** - Both jobs follow identical patterns, step ordering, and eliminate duplicate operations (v1.30)
13. **Local App Usage** - Uses local app instead of downloading from store (v1.29)
14. **Autoloader Generation** - Automatic generation of missing `lib/autoload.php` files with proper verification and error handling (v1.27)
