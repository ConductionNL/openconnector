## Version 1.18 - Enhanced App Installation Diagnostics (Current)

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Approach:** Real Nextcloud Docker environment with comprehensive app installation diagnostics

### üéØ **Strategy**
Run tests inside a real Nextcloud container with enhanced diagnostics to ensure proper app installation and class loading.

### üê≥ **Docker Stack**
- **MariaDB 10.6** - Database (matching local setup)
- **Redis 7** - Caching and sessions
- **MailHog** - Email testing (`ghcr.io/juliusknorr/nextcloud-dev-mailhog:latest`)
- **Nextcloud** - Real environment (`ghcr.io/juliusknorr/nextcloud-dev-php81:latest`)

### üîß **Key Features**
1. **Complete Service Stack** - All services linked and configured
2. **Enhanced App Installation** - Comprehensive diagnostics for OpenConnector app installation
3. **Real OCP Classes** - No mocking needed, uses actual Nextcloud classes
4. **Database Migrations** - Handled automatically by Nextcloud
5. **Local Parity** - Exact same images as local docker-compose.yml
6. **PHPUnit Autoloader Fix** - Regenerates autoloader to fix class loading issues

### üêõ **Issues Resolved**
- ‚úÖ **Missing apps-extra directory** - Added `mkdir -p` before copying
- ‚úÖ **PHPUnit command not found** - Use `./lib/composer/bin/phpunit` (correct Nextcloud path)
- ‚úÖ **PHPUnit autoloader issues** - Added `composer dump-autoload --optimize`
- ‚úÖ **App installation failures** - Enhanced diagnostics and error reporting
- ‚úÖ **Class loading issues** - Added app class availability checks

### üìÅ **Files**
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Complete Docker environment
- **`tests/bootstrap.php`** - Simplified bootstrap for container environment
- **Container cleanup** - All services cleaned up after tests

### üéØ **Benefits**
- **No MockMapper issues** - Uses real OCP classes
- **Local development parity** - Same environment as local
- **Automatic migrations** - Database setup handled by Nextcloud
- **Complete service stack** - Redis, Mail, MariaDB all available
- **Enhanced diagnostics** - Comprehensive app installation and class loading verification
- **PHPUnit autoloader fixes** - Resolves class loading issues automatically
- **Better error reporting** - Clear diagnostics when app installation fails

### üìã **Centralized Version Management**
- **`.github/workflows/versions.env`** - Single source of truth for all versions
- **Environment variables** - CI workflow uses `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` syntax
- **Local parity** - Versions match your local `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`
- **Easy updates** - Change versions in one place, affects entire CI
