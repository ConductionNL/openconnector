- Improved timing with longer delays - Testing 30-second delays for Nextcloud background processes to complete (v1.44)
- Enhanced file content diagnostics - Testing actual autoloader file content and permissions checking (v1.44)
- Comprehensive autoloader generation strategy - Testing multi-step approach with disable/enable cycle, maintenance repair, forced app update, Composer optimization, and manual creation as fallback (v1.43)
- Manual autoloader creation - Testing if manual creation of lib/autoload.php with proper PSR-4 autoloader registration works as final fallback (v1.43)
- Extended timeouts - Testing increased timeouts to handle progress bar hanging issues (v1.42)

### ✅ **Recently Fixed**
- Fixed invalid --force flag - Removed non-existent --force flag from app:update commands that was causing errors and hanging progress bars (v1.44)
- Enhanced class existence checks - Added verification that OpenConnector Application class actually exists after each autoloader generation step (v1.44)
- Improved timing with longer delays - Added 30-second delays for Nextcloud background processes to complete before checking autoloader generation (v1.44)
- Enhanced file content diagnostics - Added actual autoloader file content and permissions checking to identify malformed or incomplete files (v1.44)
- Enhanced database verification - Fixed database table verification to use proper MariaDB container connection with comprehensive diagnostics (v1.39)
- Changed app installation method - Use app:install as primary method to ensure database migrations run properly (v1.38)
- Fixed invalid app:upgrade command - Replaced with proper Nextcloud commands (db:add-missing-indices, db:add-missing-columns, db:convert-filecache-bigint) (v1.38)
- Added forced migration execution - Disable/enable cycle forces Nextcloud to execute app migration files (v1.38)
- Overly strict health checks causing false failures - Fixed health check logic to be more resilient (v1.37)
- Hanging php occ app --help command - Added 30-second timeouts and health checks (v1.36)
- Invalid Nextcloud commands - Removed `app:upgrade` (not available) and `--path` option (not supported) (v1.35)
- Command availability checking - Added `app --help` for diagnostics (v1.35)
- Duplicate app:enable calls - Removed redundant calls after migration testing (v1.35)
- Quality job step ordering - Docker containers now start before dependency installation (v1.35)
- Autoloader generation verification - Added proper verification for `lib/autoload.php` creation

### 📋 **Next Steps**
1. Test the workflow with v1.45 enhanced autoloader generation and improved class mapping
2. Verify that the heredoc syntax autoloader creation works better than manual echo commands
3. Monitor comprehensive class loading diagnostics to see if OpenConnector Application class is properly loaded
4. Check if the enhanced autoloader content structure resolves the class loading issues
5. Analyze the improved PSR-4 namespace handling and explicit Application class loading
6. Test the comprehensive autoloader generation strategy (v1.43) with enhanced diagnostics (v1.44) and improved generation (v1.45)
7. Update documentation status based on test results
