# OpenConnector GitHub Workflows Documentation

## 📄 Overview
This document tracks the evolution of OpenConnector's GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and code quality.

---

## 🚀 Version
**Current Version:** 1.50 - Per-job PHPUnit constraint, bcmath, tool path fixes  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Approach:** Define PHPUnit constraint separately in each job (tests vs quality), add missing `bcmath` PHP extension, and use container-managed tool paths under `./lib/composer/bin` for reliability.

## 🎯 Strategy
Run unit tests inside a real Nextcloud Docker container with comprehensive diagnostics and host-based autoloader generation to ensure proper class loading and test execution.

## 🐳 Docker Stack
- **MariaDB 10.6** — Database (matching local setup)
- **Redis 7** — Caching and sessions
- **MailHog** — Email testing (`ghcr.io/juliusknorr/nextcloud-dev-mailhog:latest`)
- **Nextcloud** — Real environment (`nextcloud:31`)
- **Networking (v1.49)** — Dedicated per-job Docker networks (`nc-net-tests`, `nc-net-quality`) replace deprecated `--link`, improving isolation and name-based service discovery.
- **PHP Extensions (v1.50)** — Added `bcmath` to align CI with runtime expectations.

## 🔧 Key Features & Benefits

### **🚀 Reliable Autoloader Generation**
- **Enhanced Class Loading Diagnostics** — Immediate feedback on whether OpenConnector Application class is properly loaded (v1.45)
- **Multi-Step Autoloader Strategy** — Comprehensive approach with multiple fallback methods ensures autoloader creation even when individual methods fail (v1.43)
- **Manual Autoloader Creation** — Guaranteed autoloader generation through manual creation when automated methods fail (v1.43)
- **Early Exit Checks** — Prevents step interference by stopping when autoloader is successfully created (v1.43)

### **🔧 Robust Database Management**
- **Fixed sudo Command Issues** — Install sudo in containers before use (v1.48)
- **App Enable Primary Method** — Uses `app:enable` with proper user context for reliable activation (v1.47)
- **Enhanced Database Verification** — Accurate DB state verification using MariaDB container connections (v1.39)
- **Forced Migration Execution** — Disable/enable cycles ensure migrations run (v1.38)

### **⚡ Workflow Reliability & Performance**
- **Extended Timeouts** — Handle long-running operations (180s for `app:install`, 90s for `app:enable`) (v1.42)
- **Resilient Health Checks** — Prefer warnings to avoid false failures (v1.37)
- **Command Timeout Protection** — 30s timeouts for potentially hanging `occ` commands (v1.36)
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics** - Detailed troubleshooting information for faster issue resolution (v1.36)
- **Modern Networking (v1.49)** — Per-job Docker networks for stable service resolution and cleaner teardown.

### **🎯 Development Environment Parity**
- **Local App Usage** - Tests actual development code instead of published versions (v1.29)
- **Exact Environment Match** - CI environment matches local development exactly using same Docker images (v1.14)
- **Complete Service Stack** - Full Nextcloud environment with Redis, Mail, and MariaDB services (v1.13)
- **Real OCP Classes** - No mocking needed, uses actual Nextcloud classes for real-world compatibility (v1.13)

### **🔍 Advanced Diagnostics & Monitoring**
- **Class Existence Verification** - Verifies that OpenConnector Application class actually exists after autoloader generation (v1.44)
- **File Content Diagnostics** - Checks autoloader file content and permissions to identify issues (v1.44)
- **Container Status Monitoring** - Enhanced error reporting with container status and log analysis (v1.36)
- **Available Commands Testing** - Tests only commands that actually exist in the Nextcloud environment (v1.35)

### **🔐 Security & Permissions**
- **Proper User Context** - All 65+ php occ commands execute as sudo -u www-data for correct permissions and security compliance (v1.47)
- **Simplified App Management** - Focus on app:enable approach with app:install and app:update commented out for cleaner workflow (v1.47)
- **Security Compliance** - Ensures all Nextcloud commands run with appropriate user permissions for production-like security (v1.47)

### **📁 Directory Structure & Compatibility**
- **Standardized Directory Structure** - Use `/var/www/html/custom_apps/` for better Nextcloud compatibility (v1.46)
- **Updated References** - All paths in tests and quality jobs reflect the standardized structure (v1.46)

## 🐛 Issues Resolved
- 🔄 Runner APT permission handling — runner uses `composer install`; APT actions within containers run as root via `docker exec -u 0` (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Tests/Quality job parity — identical bootstrap, diagnostics, composer strategy, migration flow, autoload verification, and logging (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Path normalization — removed `/apps/openconnector` references; standardized to `/var/www/html/custom_apps/openconnector` (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Post-copy ownership — `chown -R www-data:www-data` after `docker cp` to prevent root-owned files (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Container sudo removal — use `docker exec --user www-data` instead of `sudo -u www-data` inside containers (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Shell robustness — added `set -euo pipefail` to major run blocks (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Composer strategy — install curl+Composer as root; run app composer install as www-data; verify composer available (v1.49) - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- ✅ “sudo: command not found” — resolved by installing required tools before usage (v1.48)
- ✅ Container setup — clarified around APT/curl and Composer order (v1.48)
- ✅ Standardized directory structure — `custom_apps` over legacy locations (v1.46)

- ✅ Database verification — MariaDB container with explicit table checks (v1.39)
- ✅ Health checks and occ timeouts — prevent hangs (v1.36–v1.37)
- ✅ Composer/enable ordering — prevent missing vendor/autoload.php (v1.31–v1.33)
- ✅ Local parity — same images as local docker-compose (v1.14)
- ✅ Real Nextcloud Docker environment with full service stack (MariaDB, Redis, MailHog) — enables use of real OCP classes without brittle mocks; improves reliability of tests and diagnostics (v1.13)
- ✅ Reproducible runs — explicit container cleanup and isolation across jobs to avoid state leakage between workflow executions (v1.13)
- ✅ Comprehensive container diagnostics — added targeted logs and inspection commands (process lists, Nextcloud logs, directory listings) to speed up troubleshooting (v1.13)

## 📜 Changelog

### Version 1.50 - Per-job PHPUnit constraint, bcmath, tool path fixes
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Changes:**
- 🧪 PHPUnit constraint defined per job: `tests` job uses matrix-based `^9.6` (PHP 8.2) or `^10.5` (PHP 8.3); `quality` job sets constraint explicitly to `^10.5` for PHP 8.3. Avoids cross-job step output leakage and removes duplication.
- ➕ PHP extension `bcmath` added to both jobs' `setup-php` steps for parity with runtime requirements.
- 🛠️ Tool paths and shells: use `bash -lc` and tool binaries from `./lib/composer/bin` (php-cs-fixer, psalm) for consistent resolution inside the Nextcloud container.

### Version 1.49 - Job parity, custom_apps standardization, PHPUnit matrix, Docker networks, safer shell
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** 🔄 Testing In Progress  
**Changes:**
- 🧭 Centralized defaults via top-level `env:`; `versions.env` remains supported and, if present, is echoed in logs.
- 🧩 Tests/Quality parity: same container bootstrap, copy to `custom_apps`, ownership fix, occ diagnostics, composer strategy (curl+Composer as root; app composer install as www-data), `MIGRATION_SUCCESS` flow, DB helpers, toggle app, autoload verification, and class_exists retry.
- 📁 Path normalization: all references standardized to `/var/www/html/custom_apps/openconnector`; removed redundant copies and checks under `/apps`.
- 👤 Permissions: avoid `sudo` in containers; use `docker exec --user www-data` for all occ calls.
- 🧰 Composer: install curl+Composer as root; verify `composer --version`; run app composer install as www-data.
- 🧷 Robustness: `set -euo pipefail` added to major `run:` blocks; clearer banners/echo diagnostics for every phase.
- 🧪 PHPUnit: in-container install/verify; tests job runs with coverage and uploads to Codecov; quality job also runs with coverage output inside container.
- 🧪 PHPUnit matrix by PHP version: `^9.6` for PHP 8.2 and `^10.5` for PHP 8.3 (runner and containers).
- 🎯 Accurate code style step: renamed to PHP CS Fixer to match `friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`.
- 🌐 Modern container networking: replaced deprecated `--link` with per-job Docker networks (`nc-net-tests`, `nc-net-quality`), using service names for `MYSQL_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`, and `SMTP_HOST`. Networks are removed during cleanup.
