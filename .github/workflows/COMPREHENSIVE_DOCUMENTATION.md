**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Approach:** Real Nextcloud Docker environment with comprehensive diagnostics and app autoloader generation

### üéØ **Strategy**
Run tests inside a real Nextcloud container with comprehensive pre-class loading diagnostics to identify and fix missing app autoloader issues.

### üê≥ **Docker Stack**
- **MariaDB 10.6** - Database (matching local setup)
- **Redis 7** - Caching and sessions
- **MailHog** - Email testing (`ghcr.io/juliusknorr/nextcloud-dev-mailhog:latest`)

2. **Comprehensive Diagnostics** - Pre-class loading diagnostics to identify root causes
3. **App Autoloader Generation** - Automatic generation of missing `lib/autoload.php` files
4. **Enhanced Sleep Timing** - Increased retry mechanism sleep from 3 to 10 seconds
5. **Real OCP Classes** - No mocking needed, uses actual Nextcloud classes
6. **Database Migrations** - Handled automatically by Nextcloud
7. **Local Parity** - Exact same images as local docker-compose.yml

### üêõ **Issues Resolved**
