# GitHub Workflow Fixes

## Issues Identified from Failed Workflow Run

### 🚨 **Critical Issues Found**

1. **PHPUnit Not Found**
   - Error: `sh: 1: phpunit: not found`
   - Exit Code: 127 (command not found)
   - Root Cause: PHPUnit was not included in dev dependencies

2. **PHP Linting Failed**
   - The "Run PHP linting" step failed
   - Suggests broader PHP tool availability issues

3. **Misleading Success Messages**
   - "Test Results Summary" showed all checks as passed despite failures
   - Contradictory to actual workflow failures

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Added PHPUnit to Dev Dependencies**
```json
"require-dev": {
    "nextcloud/ocp": "dev-stable29",
    "roave/security-advisories": "dev-latest",
    "phpunit/phpunit": "^9.6"
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Composer Script**
```json
"test:unit": "./vendor/bin/phpunit tests -c tests/phpunit.xml --colors=always --fail-on-warning --fail-on-risky"
```
- Changed from `phpunit` to `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
- Ensures PHPUnit is found in the correct location

### 3. **Fixed Misleading Success Messages**
```yaml
- name: Test Results Summary
  if: always()
  run: |
    echo "## 🧪 OpenConnector Unit Tests" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    if [ "${{ job.status }}" = "success" ]; then
      echo "- ✅ PHP Linting: Completed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
      echo "- ✅ Unit Tests: Completed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
      echo "- ✅ All quality checks passed!" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    else
      echo "- ❌ PHP Linting: Failed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
      echo "- ❌ Unit Tests: Failed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
      echo "- ❌ Some quality checks failed!" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    fi
```

## 📋 **Summary of Changes**

### Files Modified:
1. **`composer.json`**
   - Added `phpunit/phpunit: ^9.6` to dev dependencies
   - Fixed `test:unit` script to use `./vendor/bin/phpunit`

2. **`pr-unit-tests.yml`**
   - Simplified test execution (removed complex PHPUnit detection)
   - Fixed misleading success messages with conditional logic

### Expected Results:
- ✅ PHPUnit will be properly installed via Composer
- ✅ Tests will run using the correct PHPUnit path
- ✅ Success/failure messages will be accurate
- ✅ Workflow will provide clear feedback on actual status

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and push** these changes to the repository
2. **Create a test pull request** to verify the fixes work
3. **Monitor the workflow run** to ensure all issues are resolved
4. **Check that PHPUnit is properly installed** in the workflow environment

## 🔍 **Verification**

The workflow should now:
- Install PHPUnit as a dev dependency
- Find PHPUnit in `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
- Run tests successfully
- Provide accurate status reporting
- Show proper success/failure indicators
